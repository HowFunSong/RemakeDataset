"Archaea form the third domain of life, alongside the 
other two domains, the Bacteria and Eukarya. The dis -
tinct archaeal lineages that have been identified include 
the Crenarchaeota (from the Greek ‘crenos’ for spring or 
origin) and the Euryarchaeota (from the Greek ‘euryos’ 
for diversity)1 (FIG. 1). Archaea resemble Bacteria in their 
structural organization and metabolism, whereas their 
genetic information system (the process of transcription)  
shares many traits with  Eukarya.

"Abstract || The acquisition of cellular carbon from inorganic carbon is a prerequisite for life 
and marked the transition from the inorganic to the organic world. Recent theories of the 
origins of life assume that chemoevolution took place in a hot volcanic flow setting through a 
transition metal-catalysed, autocatalytic carbon fixation cycle. Many archaea live in volcanic 
habitats under such constraints, in high temperatures with only inorganic substances and 
often under anoxic conditions. In this Review, we describe the diverse carbon fixation 
mechanisms that are found in archaea. These reactions differ fundamentally from those of 
the well-known Calvin cycle, and their distribution mirrors the phylogenetic positions of the 
archaeal lineages and the needs of the ecological niches that they occupy.REVIEWS

reduction of CO2 using four molecules of H2 to generate

In 1966, Arnon, Buchanan and co-workers proposed another autotrophic cycle for the green sulphur bacterium 
Chlorobium limicola , the reductive citric acid cycle (also known as the Arnon–Buchanan cycle)104. This cycle is less 
energy-consuming than the Calvin cycle, involves enzymes that are sensitive to oxygen and is therefore found only in 
anaerobes or in aerobes growing at low oxygen tensions. These include some Proteobacteria, green sulphur bacteria and 
microaerophilic bacteria of the early bacterial phylum Aquificae. Initially, the reductive citric acid cycle was also 
proposed to operate in certain archaea (notably Thermoproteus neutrophilus )20, but recent findings refute this proposal14.

organisms that now also include some Proteobacteria, Planctomycetes, spirochaetes and Euryarchaeota, one CO2

The hydroxypropionate–hydroxybutyrate cycle can 
be divided into two parts (FIG. 3b). The first transforms 
acetyl-CoA and two bicarbonate molecules through 
3-hydroxypropionate to succinyl-CoA23–25, and the 
second converts succinyl-CoA through 4 -hydroxybu -

Gluconeogenesis from acetyl-CoA

compounds must therefore begin with acetyl-CoA.

pyruvate:phosphate dikinase44,45 (FIG. 4). PEP carboxylase 
generates C4 compounds. In the aerobic Sulfolobales, 
most of the intermediate succinyl-CoA is withdrawn

Regulation of autotrophic carbon metabolism
Many autotrophic archaea are facultative autotrophs or 
they can co-assimilate organic substrates into cellular 
building blocks even though they do not use organic 
substrates as an energy source by oxidizing them to CO2. 
They often downregulate the enzymes that are specifi -

can be dramatic14, and little is known about the tran -

ple for the need of regulation is the threatening futile 
cycling of glycolysis and gluconeogenesis, which occurs 
even in heterotrophic archaea. Specifically, some hetero -
trophic archaea form FBP aldolase–phosphatase consti -
tutively, which would be deleterious during growth on 
sugars if a normal Emden–Meyerhof–Parnas pathway 
were used because the enzyme would reconvert triose 
phosphates into fructose 6 -phosphate and inorganic 
phosphate. However, if glycolysis proceeds through vari -

suggest that the common ancestor of all archaea was an 
anaerobic thermophilic chemolithoautotroph (FIG.  1). 
The same conclusion has been made from the analysis

In fact, all autotrophic pathways that are known, 
except the Calvin cycle, start biosynthesis from acetyl-
CoA, which requires the generation (or regeneration) 
of acetyl-CoA. Anaerobic autotrophic Euryarchaeota

Methanogens form acetyl-CoA de novo  from C1, 
and this choice is dictated by their energy metabolism. 
The reduction of C1 to methane allows the formation of 
acetyl-CoA by the addition of only two more enzymes: 
a methyl transferase with a methyl-accepting corrinoid 
protein and a CO dehydrogenase–acetyl-CoA syn -
thase. The anaerobic autotrophic Crenarchaeota, how -
ever, do not have this C1 unit-transforming machinery 
because they are specialized in the reduction of sulphur

anaerobic strategy to produce C4 compounds from 
acetyl-CoA and two CO2 and generate acetyl-CoA

in this reaction is also an attractive model for carbon

The autotrophic marine Crenarchaeota (which are

aerobic ammonia oxidation) seem to use the same 
mechanism of carbon fixation as the Sulfolobales.

A model for primordial metabolism?
The topic of autotrophic carbon fixation invites  
the consideration of some evolutionary scenarios. The 
‘metabolism first’ theory assumes that life started in 
a hydrothermal-vent setting in the Hadean ocean with 
catalytic metal sulphide surfaces89,90 or compartments91. 
The common ancestor of life was probably a chemolitho -
autotrophic thermophilic anaerobe86,89 –91. According to this theory, inorganic carbon fixation proceeded on 
minerals and was based on catalysis by transition metal 
sulphides. Given the structural and catalytic similarity 
between the minerals themselves and the catalytic metal 
or Fe–S-containing centres of the enzymes or cofactors",ts/Autotrophic carbon fixation in archaea.pdf,10
"sulphides. Given the structural and catalytic similarity 
between the minerals themselves and the catalytic metal 
or Fe–S-containing centres of the enzymes or cofactors 
in the acetyl-CoA pathway, one attractive idea is that 
minerals catalysed a primitive acetyl-CoA pathway85. 
There is experimental support for this idea; for example, 
both the thioester acetyl methylsulphide and its hydro -
lysed product, acetate, can be produced from CO and 
CH3SH using only Fe and Ni sulphides as catalysts92.
Several aspects of the reductive acetyl-CoA path -
way are unique, and this pathway might be close to 
the ancestral autotrophic carbon fixation pathway83. 
First, it uses CO, a common volcanic gas with strong Box 2 || Benefits of the different autotrophic pathways under different conditions

"The pros and cons of the different pathways should be considered. Given that organisms that use the Calvin cycle have 
come to dominate most aerobic ecosystems, they presumably have some advantages. Still, five other options exist that 
obviously can pre-empt such advantages. Balancing the different requirements of the autotrophic pathways might be 
what determines whether a non-Calvin-type autotrophic organism can successfully compete.
oxygen, metals and supply of c1 compounds
Autotrophic Euryarchaeota are strictly confined to anoxic conditions, generally specialized in metabolizing C1 
compounds and/or acetate, and their energy metabolism has low ATP yields. Therefore, they need much of the 
C1-transforming machinery for their energy metabolism. The reductive acetyl-coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA) pathway ideally 
copes with such constraints. Also, essential metals are more available under anoxic conditions owing to the higher",ts/Autotrophic carbon fixation in archaea.pdf,10
"copes with such constraints. Also, essential metals are more available under anoxic conditions owing to the higher 
solubility of the reduced forms of most metals. In Crenarchaeota, the oxygen-sensitive dicarboxylate–hydroxybutyrate 
cycle is restricted to the anaerobic Thermoproteales and Desulfurococcales, whereas the oxygen-insensitive hydroxypro -
pionate–hydroxybutyrate cycle is restricted to the mostly aerobic Sulfolobales and possibly marine Crenarchaeota. The 
two lifestyles presuppose different electron donors with different redox potentials and different oxygen sensitivity of 
cofactors and enzymes. In a nutshell, energy cost-effective but oxygen-sensitive mechanisms cannot exist in aerobes 
because the enzymes would be inactivated by oxygen; and not all anaerobes have C1 substrates at their disposal.
Energy demands

"Energy demands
The different pathways require different amounts of ATP to make the cellular precursor metabolites. The costs for synthesizing 
all auxiliary, CO2 fixation-related enzymes also differ, which might determine the energy costs involved. The synthesis of the 
catalysts itself can require a huge amount of energy as well as nitrogen and sulphur sources, especially if the pathways involve 
many auxiliary enzymes. Carboxylases with low catalytic efficiency must be synthesized in large amounts, as is the case for  
ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase–oxygenase105,106. So, energy limitation exerts a strong selective pressure in favour of 
energy-saving mechanisms, and the energy costs are largely spent for the synthesis of autotrophy-related enzymes.

"Metabolic fluxes
In bacteria and archea, the need for sugar phosphates in the biosynthesis of cell walls is lower than in plants, which also 
synthesize huge amounts of cellulose and lignin that is derived from erythrose 4 -phosphate and phosphoenolpyruvate  
(PEP). The main metabolic fluxes are diverted from acetyl-CoA, pyruvate, oxaloacetate and 2 -oxoglutarate, and their 
synthesis from 3 -phosphoglycerate is partly connected with a loss of CO2. Therefore, in bacteria autotrophic pathways 
directly yielding acetyl-CoA are more economical. Still, most facultative aerobic bacteria use the Calvin cycle, the 
regulation of which is almost detached from the central carbon metabolism and therefore may be particularly robust.

PEP carboxylase and biotin-dependent carboxylases (that is, acetyl-CoA–propionyl-CoA carboxylase). This property

The same might be true for acetyl-CoA–propionyl-CoA carboxylase, and the higher bicarbonate concentration could 
potentially make up for a lower bicarbonate affinity.

Many autotrophic bacteria and archaea living in aquatic habitats probably encounter carbon oligotrophic conditions and 
grow as mixotrophs. Co-assimilation of traces of organic compounds might pay off. A complete or even a rudimentary

the opposing effects of crop residues on the greenhouse gas balance of agroecosystems. Here, we combine a literature

with C:N ratio >30 and avoiding incorporation of residues from crops terminated at an immature physiological stage,

effects on yield, soil organic carbon storage, nitrate leaching and/or ammonia volatilization. We identi ﬁed additional
strategies with potential to reduce crop residue N 2O emissions without strong negative side-effects, which require fur-
ther research. These are: a) treatment of crop residues before ﬁeld application, e.g., conversion of residues into biochar
or anaerobic digestate, b) co-application with nitri ﬁcation inhibitors or N-immobilizing materials such as compost
with a high C:N ratio, paper waste or sawdust, and c) use of residues obtained from crop mixtures. Our study providesKeywords:

adequate crop residue management.
1. Introduction
Regulating atmospheric greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations and en-
suring food and nutrition for the growing world population are two of the
greatest challenges facing humanity today. Crop residue application in ag-
ricultural soils has been posited as a tool to simultaneously tackle both chal-
lenges. This is because crop residues contribute to maintaining or even
increasing soil carbon storage in soils while improving soil fertility, thereby
enhancing sustainability of food production ( Watson et al., 2002 ). How-
ever, the potential bene ﬁts of crop residue retention (i.e., the fraction of
biomass left on the ﬁeld and possibly incorporated into the soil following
harvest) for C sequestration and thus, climate change mitigation could be

"harvest) for C sequestration and thus, climate change mitigation could be
partly or fully offset by increased emissions of the powerful greenhouse
gas nitrous oxide (N 2O), as shown in several meta-analyses ( Chen et al.,
2013 ;Shan and Yan, 2013 ;Xia et al., 2018 ;Hu et al., 2019 ;Muhammad
et al., 2019 ). Agricultural soils are the largest anthropogenic source of
N2O emissions, and N 2O emissions due to crop residue retention in agricul-
turalﬁelds account for a substantial fraction of these ( EEA, 2020 ). Global
N2O emissions from crop residues have been estimated to increase steadily
over the last decades mainly due to higher crop production, reaching ap-
proximately 0.224 Gt CO 2-eq in 2017 ( FAO, 2021 ). To harness the bene ﬁts
of crop residue retention, we must identify the conditions and residue man-
agement strategies that minimize N 2O emissions after application or incor-
poration, avoiding trade-offs in terms of soil C sequestration and soil

"agement strategies that minimize N 2O emissions after application or incor-
poration, avoiding trade-offs in terms of soil C sequestration and soil
fertility.
In this study, we combine a literature review and meta-analysis to iden-
tify and assess measures for mitigating N 2O emissions from crop residues.
We evaluate the degree of certainty associated to their mitigation potential,
the most important general conditions under which every measure is ex-
pected to be effective, and positive and negative side-effects. We also pro-
pose future research avenues to address the knowledge gaps precluding
effective implementation of these measures. These knowledge gaps include
the interactions between management, climate and residue composition
that make emissions dif ﬁcult to predict at regional and global scales.
While there are other meta-analyses focused on the effect of crop residues

study is the ﬁrst one evaluating the residue management measures that
may be able to mitigate such emissions, while considering potential impacts
on other ecosystem services.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Literature review
Mitigation measures for N 2O emissions from crop residues were col-
lated from the literature using ISI Web of Science, SCOPUS and Google
Scholar. The search terms were: “residue ”OR “straw ”OR “stubble ”AND
“nitrous oxide ”OR “N2O ”OR “greenhouse gas ”OR “GHG ”OR “emission
factor ”AND “measure ”OR “strategy ”. After screening the literature, the
measures were categorized according to: residue physical management,

"measures were categorized according to: residue physical management,
residue incorporation timing, interactions with fertilisation, additives and
crop residue modi ﬁcations, crop type, and edaphoclimatic conditions
(Table 1 ). Information from the articles was used to present and discuss
the individual factors (e.g., precipitation, tillage) determining the effective-
ness of each measure. A comprehensive literature review (or purposive re-
view following Cook (2019) ) was used as a basis to assess the positive and
negative side-effects of the mitigation measures in relation to crop yields,
soil organic carbon (SOC), nitrate leaching and ammonia (NH 3) volatiliza-
tion, among others.2.2. Database
To gain a quantitative understanding of the potential of every residue
management measure to mitigate N 2O emissions from crop residues, we
conducted a meta-analysis using an extended version (as described

below) of the database compiled by Rittl et al. (2022) .B r i eﬂy, this database
contains data from ﬁeld studies across the world investigating the impact of
crop residues on N 2O emissions. Crop residues are considered as any above-
ground plant component of a crop returned to the soil. The database
consisted of 367 selected pairwise comparisons reported in 78 studies,
which met predetermined quality criteria (only studies with replication,
with detailed information, and performed under realistic ﬁeld conditions)
(Rittl et al., 2022 ). Pairwise comparisons only included observations
where a treatment (i.e., with crop residue retention) and a control(i.e., with crop residue removal) could be compared with all other factors

The database provides information about the management, site, and ex-
perimental factors from each study, which allowed us to test the effect of
several mitigation measures identi ﬁed through the literature review. To
do so, we extended the database in this study creating additional variables
that categorize the available information into moderators for a meta-
analysis. For example, according to the crop residue application method,
observations were categorized as incorporated (when crop residues were
mechanically incorporated into the soil) or surface applied (when residues
were retained at the soil surface without incorporation, e.g., via mulching).
The speci ﬁc information about crop residue incorporation depth was cate-
gorized into deep ( ≥15 cm) and shallow ( <15 cm). Information about
fertilisation at the time when the residues were incorporated was coded
as in combination with and without fertiliser application. Moreover, for",ts/A review and meta-analysis of mitigation measures for nitrous oxide-1.pdf,1
"fertilisation at the time when the residues were incorporated was coded
as in combination with and without fertiliser application. Moreover, for
studies assessing residue management in combination with fertiliser appli-
cations, we categorized studies according to the type of fertiliser applied
(synthetic, organic, or combination of synthetic and organic). The timing
of residue incorporation was grouped as autumn incorporation versus
spring incorporation.
For the measures that could not be analysed with the database, the
quantitative N
2O mitigation potential was derived from a literature review
based on individual studies for novel measures such as anaerobic digestion
of crop residues or crop residue mixtures, for which the empirical evidence
is more limited ( Table 1 ). Certain management strategies, such as liming in

were not enough observations in the database, and because the available in-
formation did not attribute the effect of the mitigation measure to N 2O
emissions from crop residues (most available strategies are focused on
fertiliser-derived N 2O emissions). Due to limited data availability, the
main edaphoclimatic drivers potentially regulating each mitigation mea-
sure are discussed qualitatively based on the literature review, and not
quantitatively through statistical tools.
2.3. Meta-analysis
The effect of mitigation measures for crop residues on soil N 2O emission
was assessed by calculating the natural logarithmic response ratio (lnR) as
an effect size for each observation ( J. Chen et al., 2020 ;X. Chen et al., 2020 ;

We conducted a weighted mixed-effects model meta-analysis using the
“rma.mv ”function from R package “metafor ”(Viechtbauer, 2010 ). Since
several studies contributed more than one paired observation, we consid-
ered “study ”and “observation ”as random factors in the mixed-effects
models. For ease of interpretation, the overall effect size was converted
into percentage change, i.e., (elnR−1)∗100%. We considered the effect
size to be signi ﬁcant (i.e., it changes N 2O emissions compared to crop resi-
due removal) when the 95% CI of experimental classes did not include zero.To evaluate statistical differences between sub-groups within mitigation
measures, we used a Wald-type test.

3. Results and discussion
In this section, for every mitigation measure we ﬁrst describe the effect
on N
2O emissions from crop residues based on either a meta-analysis or lit-
erature review (methodology based on the data availability), and then we
present the main side-effects on ecosystem services.
3.1. Crop residue removal versus residue in the ﬁeld
On average, crop residue incorporation increases soil N 2O emissions by
40–50% compared to scenarios where residues are removed from the ﬁeld
(Abalos et al., 2022 ). Accordingly, the easiest way to reduce N 2Oe m i s s i o n sfrom aboveground crop residue retention in the ﬁeld would be removing
the crop residues, thus eliminating N and C compounds which would fuel
soil microbial processes. However, crop residue removal cannot be general-
ized as a bene ﬁcial management practice. This is because crop residue in-
corporation into the soil can sometimes decrease N 2Oﬂuxes (more details",ts/A review and meta-analysis of mitigation measures for nitrous oxide-1.pdf,2
"ized as a bene ﬁcial management practice. This is because crop residue in-
corporation into the soil can sometimes decrease N 2Oﬂuxes (more details
in the following sections), and because crop residues enhance other
agroecosystem services that may outweigh the mitigation bene ﬁts for
N2O of removing crop residues ( Table 1 ). For example, removing crop res-
idues represents a substantial export of nutrients out of the ﬁeld, which has
negative effects on crop yields and SOC stocks in the long-term ( Chowdhury
et al., 2015 ). An increased requirement for N fertilisation will be needed in
the medium to long term to partially compensate for the nutrient exports,
increasing the risk for N 2O emissions. As SOC stocks may decrease, also
the soil anion retention capacity decreases, which has been found to stimu-
late nitrate leaching from fertiliser application ( Xia et al., 2018 ). Removal
of crop residues also decreases the soil water holding capacity, soil struc-",ts/A review and meta-analysis of mitigation measures for nitrous oxide-1.pdf,2
"late nitrate leaching from fertiliser application ( Xia et al., 2018 ). Removal
of crop residues also decreases the soil water holding capacity, soil struc-
tural stability, soil water in ﬁltration as well as increase soil bulk density
and erosion, factors that may in ﬂuence negatively crop productivity and
ecosystem services. Crop residues sustain decomposer food webs in arable
soil; therefore, removing crop residues denies a source of energy for soil bi-
ological activity and growth with potentially negative impacts on nutrientretention and soil biodiversity ( Liu et al., 2016 ;Drost et al., 2020 ). The neg-
ative aspects of removing crop residues from the ﬁeld could be partially
compensated if they are used for e.g., biofuel production and biore ﬁnery,
which would increase farmers´ revenue and decrease farm level GHG
emissions.

"driven by the type of crop residue. This is because crop residues can have
large differences in biochemical characteristics. The most common bio-
chemical property used to predict the effect of crop residues on N 2Oe m i s -
sions is the C:N ratio. Crop residues with a C:N ratio lower than 20 –30
are expected to cause net N mineralization due to their high N concentra-
tion, while those with C:N ratios higher than 30, as is generally the case
in cereal straw, were found to result in net N immobilization ( Alexander,
1977 ;Trinsoutrot et al., 2000 ;Redin et al., 2014 ). A recent meta-analysis
conﬁrms this threshold and indicates that the balance between net N min-
eralization and immobilization explains the differences in N 2O emissions
between crop types according to their C:N ratios ( Abalos et al., 2022 ). Im-

Recent studies have shown that the degree of crop maturity at which the
residues are generated can be a simple and robust way to integrate crop res-
idue biochemical characteristics of importance for N 2O emissions, in addi-
tion to the C:N ratio. According to this categorization, incorporation of
residues from immature crops into the soil after crop termination increases
N2O emissions compared to incorporation of residues from mature crops

Nkongolo, 2015 ), including reductions of N losses in the form of nitrate
leaching ( Abdalla et al., 2019 ), potentially reducing soil N 2O emissions dur-

sence of fertilisation. These effects may be species-speci ﬁc, with legumes
promoting higher emissions than non-legumes due to their lower capac-
ity/need to acquire N from the soil ( Muhammad et al., 2019 ). In grassland,

"sions, especially legume-based herbage. Compared to roots and stubbles,
herbage has a higher degradability due to its biochemical composition
and lack of interaction with soil mineral particles ( Rasse et al., 2005,
2006 ). Residues from vegetable production are particularly prone to caus-
ing high N 2O emissions due to the high input of highly degradable C and
N from their residues, and due to their high requirements for fertilisers, ir-
rigation, and tillage ( Baggs et al., 2000 ;Nett et al., 2015 ;Nett et al., 2016 ;
Qasim et al., 2021 ).
Alternatives to incorporation of immature crop residues may have pos-
itive side-effects. For example, immature crops can be sold as animal feed,
increasing farmer's revenue. Incorporating cover crop residues into the soil
may hinder rapid establishment of the succeeding crop by slow soilwarming when used as mulch ( O'Brien and Daigh, 2019 ), or due to release
of growth inhibiting substances ( Putnam and DeFrank, 1983 ). By removing",ts/A review and meta-analysis of mitigation measures for nitrous oxide-1.pdf,3
"of growth inhibiting substances ( Putnam and DeFrank, 1983 ). By removing
crop residues, the risk for transferring residue-borne pathogens and plant
diseases from one season to the next, decreases ( Govaerts et al., 2007 ).
Many of these negative aspects can be avoided or reduced if crop residues
are removed from the ﬁeld, or if residues are treated (biochar or digestate,
seeSection 3.6 ) before incorporation. On the other hand, there are numer-
ous reasons to incorporate immature crop residues into the soil. They are
nutrient rich, and therefore incorporation into the soil may increase nutri-
ent supply to the succeeding crop and decrease N fertiliser requirements,which is of particular importance for organic vegetable growers. Cover

The decay rate of crop residues placed on the soil surface is generally
slower than if incorporated into the soil. This is because highly variable
moisture conditions and N limitation at the soil surface hamper residue de-
composition, and this is particularly true for mature residues having moder-
ate to high C:N ratio ( Coppens et al., 2007 ;Chaves et al., 2021 ;Chen et al.,
2014 ). Surface-applied residues may increase the distance between C sub-
strates and soil N, limiting N availability for decomposers and thus lowering
soil N immobilization effects by residues ( Coppens et al., 2007 ). Therefore,",ts/A review and meta-analysis of mitigation measures for nitrous oxide-1.pdf,3

soil N immobilization effects by residues ( Coppens et al., 2007 ). Therefore,
residues may increase mineral N, soluble C and moisture at the soil-mulch
interface, representing a hot spot of denitri ﬁcation ( Kravchenko et al.,
2018 ). Thus, surface application of residues could lead either to lower or
higher N
2O emissions depending on the environmental conditions (rain-
evaporation regime, and residue type, mulch mass and thickness). This is
reﬂected in our meta-analysis, where N 2O emissions from surface-applied
or incorporated residues are not signi ﬁcantly different due to the large var-
iation within each category ( Fig. 1 ).

face crop residue application compared to soil incorporation ( Xia et al.,

Although the effect was not signi ﬁcant, our meta-analysis indicates a
trend for higher N 2O emissions when crop residues were incorporated at
depth ( >15 cm) as compared to a shallower incorporation ( Fig. 2 ;P≤
0.10). This is probably an interactive effect of crop residue placement and
the tillage system required for such placement. Six et al. (2004) argued
that long-term adoption of no-till as compared to reduced tillage
(i.e., shallow incorporation) increases soil organic matter content in the
upper soil layers, and results in improved soil structure. The latter may de-
crease the tendency for the formation of anaerobic microsites conducive to
N2O production ( Malhi et al., 2006 ;Ussiri et al., 2009 ). Additionally, O 2dif-
fusion rates decrease with soil depth, thus crop residue decomposition is

tumn incorporation are that it may increase nitrate leaching ( Hansen

and losses of phosphorus ( Bechmann and Bøe, 2021 ). In areas prone to
freezing during winter, residue incorporation in the autumn can greatly
increase N 2O emissions compared to incorporation in the spring

tion may increase N 2O emissions ( Taghizadeh-Toosi et al., 2021 ). This is

triﬁcation not only due to anaerobiosis but also by provisioning of labile
C(Butterbach-Bahl et al., 2013 ). However, clear generalizations regarding
this effect are not possible, since the outcome in terms of N 2O emissions is
likely to depend on interactions between soil moisture, residue incorpora-
tion depth, soil properties including soil compaction, as well as residueproperties ( Kravchenko et al., 2018 ). Reviewing pairwise comparisons of

under suitable dry soil conditions is important to maintain a good soil struc-
ture and avoid soil compaction. Ideally, residues should be incorporated
when the soil is dry, but with expected rain ahead in arid and semiarid re-
gions, as water stress at the time of residue incorporation slows down its
mineralization by the soil microbial community ( Manzoni et al., 2012 ;

"3.5. Interactions with fertilisation
Studies using15N-labelled fertilisers applied in combination with
crop residues have found that the fertiliser is the dominant source
of N 2O(Machado et al., 2021 ). When N fertilisers are applied with
crop residues (particularly matu re residues with a high C:N ratio),
part of the available N from the fertiliser can be immobilized due to
the supply of organic C from the residues. Accordingly, the availabil-
ity of soil mineral N and the release of N 2O from the soil are reduced.
This is consistent with studies t hat have shown a reduction in N 2O
emissions if crop residues and fertiliser N are applied at the same
time ( Xu et al., 2019 ). However, other studies have shown that N 2O
emissions can be increased where a combination of fertiliser and res-
idues are applied to soil ( Abalos et al., 2013 ). It is likely that these
different outcomes are explained by the type of residues returned",ts/A review and meta-analysis of mitigation measures for nitrous oxide-1.pdf,5
"idues are applied to soil ( Abalos et al., 2013 ). It is likely that these
different outcomes are explained by the type of residues returned
and associated net immobilization/mineralization processes, as ex-
plained above. Other controlling factors may be the fertiliser form
(e.g., granule or liquid), and the spatial distribution of the fertiliser
and the residues in the soil, as these factors determine the physical
interaction between them.

"and associated N 2O emissions ( Decock, 2014 ). However, it is also
possible that this result is due to a confounding effect between
fertiliser type and residue type, since most crop residues linked to
organic fertiliser application in o ur database were immature crops
(grasslands, vegetables and cover crops), which induce higher N 2O
emissions. Even if organic fertilisers increase N 2O emissions
from crop residues, their use is crucial for the delivery of other
agroecosystem services. This is because organic fertilisers provide
several nutrients (e.g., P, K) in addition to N, and may increase SOC
and yield in poor soils. Using organic fertilisers avoids energy con-
sumption and emissions of GHGs during the industrial Haber-Bosch
process of N- ﬁxation for synthetic fertiliser production and promotes
circularity of nutrients at farm to regional scale.3.6. Residue removal, transformation, and return under other forms

3.6.1. Biochar
A potential strategy to mitigate N 2O emissions from crop residues is to
turn them into biochar, and then apply this material to the ﬁeld. Biochar
is the C-rich product derived from biomass pyrolysis of organic feedstocks,
such as crop residues. Recent meta-analyses have shown that biochar can
decrease N 2O emissions after application with an average reduction of
about 20% ( Shakoor et al., 2021 ); however, a meta-analysis of ﬁeld studies
across several cropping systems, including maize, wheat, rice, vegetables,
and pasture showed no robust evidence for emissions reductions despite
tendencies for reductions of up to 17% ( Verhoeven et al., 2017 ). The pro-
cesses by which biochar affects N 2O emissions remain poorly understood

"cesses by which biochar affects N 2O emissions remain poorly understood
(Cayuela et al., 2014 ) and may, in addition to changes in chemical and
physical soil structure, involve changes in the soil microbial community af-
fecting N 2O reducers ( Krause et al., 2018 ). The pyrolysis process will re-
move most of the N from the biochar, and the resulting biochar material
degrades very slowly in soil and has negligible N fertilisation effects. There-
fore, N in the removed crop residues needs to be substituted by other N
sources, typically fertiliser N.
The use of biochar presents numerous positive side-effects. The pyroly-
sis process produces gas that may be used for producing fuels or heat for
substituting fossil fuels. Biochar has been shown to be stable in soil, and itmay also contribute to stabilisation of existing soil organic C, having overall
positive effects on soil C sequestration ( Wang et al., 2016 ). In addition, bio-",ts/A review and meta-analysis of mitigation measures for nitrous oxide-1.pdf,5

char application will in general improve soil physical and chemical proper-
ties such as increasing the pH of acidic soils, water and nutrient retention,
and cation exchange capacity ( Biederman and Harpole, 2013 ;Borchard
et al., 2019 ). This may lead to improved crop yields, where such soil prop-
erties are currently limiting crop growth and yield ( Majunder et al., 2019 ).
A recent meta-analysis has shown that biochar addition reduced nitrate
leaching by on average 13% ( Borchard et al., 2019 ), but only in arable
farming and vegetable cropping, with no effects in perennial cropping sys-
tems.

cation costs, and the fact that the process of biochar production largely

other sources; however, the greater retention of nutrients in biochar",ts/A review and meta-analysis of mitigation measures for nitrous oxide-1.pdf,5

other sources; however, the greater retention of nutrients in biochar
amended soils may reduce the long-term effects of this reduction in N in-
puts ( Biederman and Harpole, 2013 ). Another negative effect of removing
crop residues for production of biochar is the lower inputs of metabolizable
C that can support macro- and micro-fauna, and this may have longer term
negative effects on soil biodiversity and soil functions ( Tibbett et al., 2020 ).
3.6.2. Anaerobic digestion
Crop residues may be collected and treated by anaerobic digestion,
alone or together with livestock manure, to produce biogas and (co)
digestates. The speci ﬁcs of biogas treatment, however, will depend on the
biomass processed. Considerable efforts have been made to exploit ﬁbre-
rich crop residues such as straw from rapeseed, maize, wheat, rice, and

synthetic N fertilisers or with a combination of organic and synthetic. The

"availability of easily degradable C, and consequently, the stimulating effect
on the soil microbial community is limited. This also means that soils stay
aerobic following anaerobic digestate application, which reduces the po-
tential to stimulate N 2O emissions ( Brozyna et al., 2013 ). However, it
should be acknowledged that residual (particulate) organic matter in
digestates has a high water retention capacity compared to bulk soil and,
if co-digested with livestock manure, will give N-rich organic hotspots
that may still have a potential for high N 2O emissions ( Baral et al., 2017 ).
Therefore, the balance between stimulation or reduction of soil N 2Oe m i s -
sions will depend on the interaction between digestate quality and soil con-
ditions ( Thomsen et al., 2010 ;Li et al., 2016 ).

Heat and power generation from anaerobic digestion may partially sub-
stitute fossil fuels and thereby reduce radiative forcing from anthropogenic
emissions of carbon dioxide ( Don et al., 2012 ). Digestates normally contain
a higher proportion of N in mineral form available for plant uptake
(Sommer and Husted, 1995 ;De Vries et al., 2012 ), and this will also
apply when immature crop residues are digested. Following biogas treat-
ment, the digestate of crop residues can be recycled for maintenance of
soil C stocks and soil quality ( Thomsen et al., 2013 ), but the effect on the
long-term stabilisation of soil C stocks (per unit of initial residue amount)

interfaces ( Witzgall et al., 2021 ), and hence occlusion and stabilisation
may be closely associated with the initial decomposition process that isintercepted by removal of residues for treatment, although this stabilisation
mechanism may well be less important for aboveground compared to be-
lowground residues ( Rasse et al., 2005 ).
3.7. Additives for application with crop residues3.7.1. Nitri ﬁcation inhibitors
In recent years, the potential of nitri ﬁcation inhibitors (NIs) to reduce N
losses from crop residues has been explored. NIs were developed to im-
prove the N use ef ﬁciency of synthetic and organic fertilisers. Synthetic in-
hibitors such as dicyandiamide (DCD), nitrapyrin, and 3,4-dimethyl-
pyrazole phosphate (DMPP), operate by chelating Cu, which is involved
in the ﬁrst step of nitri ﬁcation, ammonia oxidation ( Subbarao et al.,",ts/A review and meta-analysis of mitigation measures for nitrous oxide-1.pdf,6
"pyrazole phosphate (DMPP), operate by chelating Cu, which is involved
in the ﬁrst step of nitri ﬁcation, ammonia oxidation ( Subbarao et al.,
2006 ;Corrochano-Monsalve et al., 2021 ). The inhibition is temporary
and will cease with biodegradation of the NI ( Lees, 1946 ).
Numerous studies have shown that NIs can reduce emissions of N
2O
from nitri ﬁcation by inhibiting ammonia monooxygenase activity ( Byrne
et al., 2020 ), and from denitri ﬁcation and nitri ﬁer denitri ﬁcation by reduc-
ing the production of nitrate and nitrite ( Ruser and Schulz, 2015 ). When
used with synthetic fertilisers or manure, NIs often lead to 30 –50% N 2Or e -
ductions ( Qiao et al., 2015 ). It is therefore relevant to elucidate if NIs can
also mediate against emissions of N 2O from crop residues. Chaves et al.
(2006) found that treating vegetable crop residues with DCD or DMPP be-
fore incorporation reduced N 2O emissions. Ammonia oxidising bacteria",ts/A review and meta-analysis of mitigation measures for nitrous oxide-1.pdf,6
"(2006) found that treating vegetable crop residues with DCD or DMPP be-
fore incorporation reduced N 2O emissions. Ammonia oxidising bacteria
are stimulated near interfaces between the soil and residues, and this activ-
ity can be inhibited by treating aboveground parts of grass-legume pastures
with DMPP prior to incorporation ( Duan et al., 2017 ). However, the effect
on N 2O emissions is variable, and effects ranging from 0 to 33% reduction
have been observed in studies simulating spraying of grassland with DMPP
before cultivation ( Duan et al., 2017 ;Kong et al., 2017 ;Nair et al., 2020 ).
Treatment effects depend on residue distribution, and on soil O 2and
NO3−availability, and together these factors determine the balance be-
tween aerobic and anaerobic residue decomposition, and the proportion
of N 2O being converted to N 2(Senbayram et al., 2012 ).

of N 2O being converted to N 2(Senbayram et al., 2012 ).
Since NH 4+is much less mobile in soil environments compared to NO 3−
or NO 2−, NIs can reduce nitrate leaching ( Qiao et al., 2015 ) and thereby sup-
port higher N use ef ﬁciency in crop production ( Abalos et al., 2014 ). As ni-
triﬁcation is also an O 2consuming process, its inhibition may also
substantially increase soil O 2availability for residue decomposition around
residue-soil interfaces ( Nguyen et al., 2017 ). Some aspects need to be con-
sidered before NIs can be widely adopted. The use of nitri ﬁcation inhibitors
represents a cost to farmers, and incentives could be necessary if introduced
for GHG mitigation. Cost estimates vary widely, from 10 to 90 €ha−1yr−1(MacLeod et al., 2015 ). The delay of ammonia oxidation can increase NH 3

iour of the earthworm Lumbricus terrestris were seen in a mesocosm study

above-ground parts ( Kong et al., 2017 ), which indicates that non-target ef-
fects on e.g., the soil fauna may be limited, although this should be docu-
mented for individual NIs before being widely adopted.
3.7.2. N-immobilizing materials with high C:N ratio
Co-incorporation of N-immobilizing organic materials with immature
crop residues can be a strategy to reduce N losses from crop residues
(Congreves et al., 2013 ;Agneessens et al., 2014 ). It has been shown that
materials such as immature compost with a high C:N ratio, straw, paper
waste and sawdust can reduce nitrate leaching under controlled conditions,
but the effect on N 2O emissions has not been widely investigated ( Chaves",ts/A review and meta-analysis of mitigation measures for nitrous oxide-1.pdf,6
"waste and sawdust can reduce nitrate leaching under controlled conditions,
but the effect on N 2O emissions has not been widely investigated ( Chaves
et al., 2005 ). In a laboratory experiment, Chaves et al. (2005) found that
co-incorporation of straw, immature compost and sawdust with residues
from celery reduced cumulative N 2O emissions by more than 50%. How-
ever, homogeneous mixing of the organic materials is important to obtain
N immobilization, and this can be dif ﬁcult to achieve under ﬁeld conditions
(Chaves et al., 2005 ), and such efforts may also increase costs and manage-
ment complexity for farmers. Depending on the characteristics of the or-
ganic materials and the speci ﬁc conditions in the soil, the N
immobilization phase could be followed more or less rapidly by re-
mineralization ( Chen et al., 2014 ). Thus, N 2O emissions could pick up in
the medium to long term.

the medium to long term.
Co-incorporation of N-immobilizing materials can lead to decreased ni-
trate leaching, and co-addition of organic C may potentially increase SOC in
the long term, with possible positive effects on crop yield in poor soils.
Transient increases in CH 4oxidation (sink) capacity in upland soils have
been observed ( Ho et al., 2015 ). As with mature residues having high C:N
ratios, the potentially negative impacts of net N immobilization need to
be managed carefully.
3.8. Crop mixtures versus single crops
Residues from crop mixtures may decrease (or increase) N 2O emissions
compared to single crop residues. The reason is that mixtures of crop resi-
dues with contrasting biochemical characteristics can promote positive or
negative non-additive effects on N release from the residues ( Redin et al.,
2014 ;Porre et al., 2020 ), with potential consequences for N 2Oe m i s s i o n s .",ts/A review and meta-analysis of mitigation measures for nitrous oxide-1.pdf,6
"negative non-additive effects on N release from the residues ( Redin et al.,
2014 ;Porre et al., 2020 ), with potential consequences for N 2Oe m i s s i o n s .
Non-additive effects are frequently explained by the nutrient transfer hy-
pothesis: decomposers ﬁrst use residues with a high N concentration, and
then the released N becomes available and facilitates the decomposition
of the more recalcitrant crop residue fractions ( Hättenschwiler et al.,
2005 ;Handa et al., 2014 ). Alternative explanations for positive non-
additive effects include changes in C:N ratios ( Zhou et al., 2019 ), improved
water retention due to one of the residues in the mixture ( Wardle et al.,
2003 ), and enhanced fungal decomposer community due to wider variation
in residue biochemical properties ( Hättenschwiler et al., 2005 ;Otsing et al.,
2018 ). Conversely, transfer of inhibitory compounds and/or phenolics be-
tween residues may cause negative non-additive effects ( Freschet et al.,",ts/A review and meta-analysis of mitigation measures for nitrous oxide-1.pdf,6
"2018 ). Conversely, transfer of inhibitory compounds and/or phenolics be-
tween residues may cause negative non-additive effects ( Freschet et al.,
2012 ). These interactions have been mainly studied to understand decom-
position rates and nutrient release from litter mixtures, but the conse-
quences for N 2O emissions remain elusive. In the few available studies
evaluating N 2O emissions from plant mixtures under ﬁeld conditions, the
contribution of residue-derived N 2O emissions was not determined
(e.g., Davis et al., 2019 ;Abalos et al., 2021 ). If future research con ﬁrms
the N 2O mitigation potential of residue mixtures, they can be implemented
in many agroecosystems: multi-species swards in grasslands, cover crops,
diversi ﬁed crop rotations (effects such as changes in decomposer communi-
ties are expected to act over longer time-frames than a cropping season),
and also in intercropping ( Abalos et al., 2019 ). For cropping systems",ts/A review and meta-analysis of mitigation measures for nitrous oxide-1.pdf,6

"Plant species mixtures can provide a range of ecosystem services,
such as increased crop and forage yield, yield stability, pollinator diver-
sity and production, and weed and pest suppression ( Isbell et al., 2017 ).
Plant mixtures can also reduce nitrate leaching and soil erosion ( Gurr
et al., 2003 ;Leimer et al., 2015 ;Tribouillois et al., 2016 ), and increase
SOC ( J. Chen et al., 2020 ;X. Chen et al., 2020 ). The challenges of
implementing plant mixtures include, among others, development of
new machinery, dif ﬁculties selecting species according to local climatic
and soil variables, as well as adjusting N fertiliser management to multi-
species mixtures ( Abalos et al., 2019 ). These dif ﬁculties may reduce
adoption by farmers.

"Previous meta-analyses have found lower N
2O emissions after crop res-
idue application to ﬁelds for soils with a high clay content ( Chen et al.,
2013 ;Xia et al., 2018 ). This may be because high clay content
(i) decreases soil aeration and O 2availability, thereby decreasing residue
N release from decomposition ( Skiba and Ball, 2002 ), and (ii) lowers gas
diffusivity, promoting N 2O reduction to N 2via complete denitri ﬁcation
(Gu et al., 2013 ). This implies that avoiding crop residue incorporation in
coarse-textured soils whenever possible could be an N 2O mitigation strat-
egy. From a climate change perspective, this may provide a dual bene ﬁt:

"may be the ones with the lowest N 2O emissions after crop residue incorpo-
ration, particularly if the initial SOC content is low. This needs to be con-
ﬁrmed in future studies, since the positive relationship between soil clay
content and the capacity of soil to store C is not always consistent ( Liu
et al., 2014 ), and because increases in SOC may eventually lead to higher
N2Oe m i s s i o n s( Guenet et al., 2021 ). From an implementation perspective,
farmers do not get to choose the soil texture of their ﬁelds, and therefore
any action to address this mitigation measure must be mediated via re-
gional, national and international land use policies. These policies must
consider other important side-effects of incorporating crop residues intothe soil according to soil type. Indeed, due to differences in water holding
capacity, crop residue retention may increase nitrate leaching losses in
sandy soils, while it may reduce them in loamy and clay-textured soils",ts/A review and meta-analysis of mitigation measures for nitrous oxide-1.pdf,7

(Xia et al., 2018 ). In addition to higher soil C retention following crop res-
idue return in ﬁne-textured soils, NH

also lower in these soils due to higher CEC and ammonium adsorption by
clay particles ( Xia et al., 2018 ).
3.9.2. Aridity index <1v s>1
Recently, the IPCC guidelines for emission inventories divided the emis-
sion factors of N sources, including crop residues, according to an aridity
index (AI; mean annual precipitation to mean annual potential evapotrans-
piration). Higher emissions are assigned to crop residues in regions where
AI is>1 (0.6%; uncertainty range 0.1 –1.1%) compared to regions where
AI is<1 (0.5%; uncertainty range 0.0 –1.1%). A recent meta-analysis sup-
ports this decision ( Abalos et al., 2022 ), although the differentiation for",ts/A review and meta-analysis of mitigation measures for nitrous oxide-1.pdf,7
"AI is<1 (0.5%; uncertainty range 0.0 –1.1%). A recent meta-analysis sup-
ports this decision ( Abalos et al., 2022 ), although the differentiation for
crop residues may be stronger than indicated by IPCC, since N 2Oe m i s s i o n s
from crop residues were 2 times higher for studies conducted under an AI
>1. Consequently, limiting crop residue retention in regions where the AI
>1 could be particular important for mitigation. However, as with soil
clay content, this strategy to reduce N 2O emissions from crop residues re-
quires thorough examination before it can be implemented by national or
international land use policies, speci ﬁcally as side effects on soil C storage
are to be expected. That is, avoiding crop residue incorporation in regions
with AI >1 may reduce soil C ( Hu et al., 2018 ), and negatively impact soil
health ( Jansson et al., 2021 ). From a climate change perspective, AI is

projected to decline in some regions ( Lickley and Solomon, 2018 ), thus po-
tentially reducing N 2O emissions. For a given soil texture, with decreasing
AI, soil moisture is likely to be lower, and thus reduce the risk of nitrate
leaching losses from the incorporated residues.4. Future research priorities
In general, we argue that studies focused on crop residues should run for
at least 10 years, since changes in SOC and associated side-effects are slow
and likely undetectable over shorter time frames. Long-term monitoring of
N2O and N losses through hydrological pathways would also be required to
understand the impact of e.g., high C:N residues ( >30), and of adding N-
immobilizing materials such as green waste compost or sawdust on N losses
and to detect effects due to the possible re-mineralization of the
immobilized N ( Chaves et al., 2005 ). Such long-term studies should explore",ts/A review and meta-analysis of mitigation measures for nitrous oxide-1.pdf,7
"and to detect effects due to the possible re-mineralization of the
immobilized N ( Chaves et al., 2005 ). Such long-term studies should explore
the maximum amount of residues that can be removed from the ﬁeld under
given management and climate regimes to avoid soil degradation ( Merante
et al., 2017 ), and the potential for using surplus residues as biofuel feed-
stock. We also stress that existing long-term trials need to be continued,
but with a wider, multi-criteria focus, including GHG balances, nitrate
leaching, yields, pathogens, and economic assessments, and expanded for
different residue management options.
Up to now there is no targeted research available investigating the im-
pact of residue incorporation timing in relation to soil moisture conditions,

of residue removal or incorporation by ploughing) may result in decreasedN

this mitigation opportunity.
For anaerobic digestion of crop residues, high pressure or temperature
(or additives) can limit the cost-effectiveness of pre-treatments of ﬁbre-
rich biomass strongly, but combinations of treatments hold some promise
for future developments and should be explored ( Yu et al., 2019 ). Harvest
time and composition of (low-quality and high-quality) crop biomass for
anaerobic digestion can improve biogas yield as well as nutrient availability
and soil biodiversity after ﬁeld application ( Drost et al., 2020 ;Fontaine",ts/A review and meta-analysis of mitigation measures for nitrous oxide-1.pdf,7
"anaerobic digestion can improve biogas yield as well as nutrient availability
and soil biodiversity after ﬁeld application ( Drost et al., 2020 ;Fontaine
et al., 2020 ), and this may also be true without digestion ( Struijk et al.,
2020 ). The consequences of these treatments for digestate biochemical
composition and associated effects on N 2O emissions after ﬁeld application,
remain largely unknown.
Cost-effective use of nitri ﬁcation inhibitors as a GHG mitigation strategy
will require a better understanding of which conditions support
nitriﬁcation-dependent N 2O emissions. This will likely depend on residue
characteristics such as C:N ratio and O 2demand, and on soil nitrate avail-
ability and O 2supply. Some plant species can produce secondary metabo-
lites that function as biological nitri ﬁcation inhibitors, although
mechanisms are not clear and results mixed; mechanisms may involve ef-
fects on N mineralization, as well as on nitri ﬁcation ( Pijlman et al.,",ts/A review and meta-analysis of mitigation measures for nitrous oxide-1.pdf,7
"mechanisms are not clear and results mixed; mechanisms may involve ef-
fects on N mineralization, as well as on nitri ﬁcation ( Pijlman et al.,
2020 ). It is also not clear if such effects persist when plant residues of
crops with ability to release biological nitri ﬁcation inhibitors are incorpo-
rated ahead of a new growing season.
Research should also consider possible means of reducing direct N 2O
emissions from immature residues. For example, immature residues can
be used as feedstock for protein extraction through biore ﬁning due to
their high N content, and the remaining residue fraction with increased C:
N ratio could then be returned to the ﬁeld. However, the economic viability
of this processes needs to be assessed. Another option would be to modify
crop biochemical characteristics either by breeding or with chemicals

termination (i.e., mowing, herbicide) affects residue decomposition and N
mineralization ( Snapp and Borden, 2005 ), but the resulting effect on N

emissions deserves further research attention. We also need a better under-
standing of how farmers actually manage crop residues, as this would allow
for living lab approaches.

in microbial communities) may affect N 2O emissions, and to rank their rel-
ative importance. Then, we will be able to translate these ﬁndings into real-

regulators of residue interactions. Incorporating this information into crop,

scale the relationships between N 2O and soil clay content are consistent,

the relationships prove to be robust, future studies can use digital soil map-
ping (e.g., remote sensing, satellite imagery) to identify regional hotspots
for N 2O emissions from crop residues, and to propose management prac-
tices to minimize them. Similarly, the aridity index is effectively a proxy
for soil moisture content. However, the effect of AI and soil moisture on
soil C and N cycling is complex. Some studies have shown increases in AI

As global temperatures rise, large amounts of carbon sequestered in permafrost are becoming available for microbial 
degradation. Accurate prediction of carbon gas emissions from thawing permafrost is limited by our understanding of 
these microbial communities. Here we use metagenomic sequencing of 214 samples from a permafrost thaw gradient

"to recover 1,529 metagenome-assembled genomes, including many from phyla with poor genomic representation. 
These genomes reflect the diversity of this complex ecosystem, with genus-level representatives for more than sixty 
per cent of the community. Meta-omic analysis revealed key populations involved in the degradation of organic matter, 
including bacteria whose genomes encode a previously undescribed fungal pathway for xylose degradation. Microbial and 
geochemical data highlight lineages that correlate with the production of greenhouse gases and indicate novel syntrophic 
relationships. Our findings link changing biogeochemistry to specific microbial lineages involved in carbon processing, 
and provide key information for predicting the effects of climate change on permafrost systems.

"Permafrost thaw induced by climate change is predicted to make up to

able for microbial degradation by 21001. Prediction of the magnitude 
of carbon loss as carbon dioxide (CO 2) or methane (CH 4) is hampered 
by our limited knowledge of microbial metabolism of organic matter  
in these environments. Genome-centric metagenomic analysis of 
microbial communities provides the necessary information to examine 
how specific lineages transform organic matter during permafrost thaw. 
However, these methods are challenged by the inherent complexity 
and spatial heterogeneity of near-surface soil communities that sup -

The discontinuous permafrost at Stordalen Mire in northern Sweden

To gain an understanding of the microbial communities at this site and 
their associated carbon metabolism, soil samples were collected from

"an intact palsa (thawed to approximately 30 cm), a partially thawed bog

exist in diverse landscapes, thaw-associated shifts in hydrology cause

"Ca. ‘ Acidiflorens’ species (Ca . ‘ Acidiflorens’ sp. 2), both of which are 
detected only in the fen, were also correlated (R2 = 0.19, P = 1 × 10−4; 
Fig. 3c). The species-level resolution afforded by the genome-centric metagenomic approach allowed identification of potential interactions 
between microorganisms and biogeochemistry that would have been 
missed using traditional gene amplicon surveys.
Another key but poorly constrained biogeochemical parameter 
in global CH 4 models37 is the percentage of carbon mineralized to  
CO 2 versus CH 4. We directly examined the relationship of microbial 
lineages in the bog with the porewater CH 4:CO 2 ratio and identified 
a significant positive correlation with a genus within the candidate  
phylum Dormibacteraeota38, named here Ca . ‘Changshengia’

Conclusion
Here, genome-centric metagenomic analysis of a permafrost  
thaw gradient allowed the recovery of 1,529 MAGs, substantially increasing the number of genomes sequenced from permafrost-
 
associated environments. Analysis of these genomes and their

Study site.  As described previously34, Stordalen Mire is a peatland in northern 
Sweden (68 22ʹ N, 19 03ʹ E), 10 km southeast of Abisko. The three sub-habitats 
of the study site are common to northern wetlands, and together cover ~98% 
of Stordalen Mire’s non-lake surface10. These proceed from well-drained palsas 
underlain by permafrost, and dominated by ericaceous and woody plants, to 
intermediate-thaw bogs with variable water table depth, dominated by Sphagnum  
spp. mosses, to fully thawed and inundated fens dominated by sedges such as 
Eriophorum angustifolium . A thaw-associated shift in these habitats was docu-
mented between 1970 and 2000, as palsa collapsed and bogs and fens expanded 
by 3% and 54%, respectively10. These habitats exist in an intermingled mosaic, as 
is common in discontinuous permafrost zones, and the specific palsa, bog and 
fen that were sampled in this study are directly adjacent such that all cores were",ts/C processing.pdf,6
"is common in discontinuous permafrost zones, and the specific palsa, bog and 
fen that were sampled in this study are directly adjacent such that all cores were 
collected within a 120 m radius.
This formation of wetlands after permafrost thaw is a widespread characteristic 
of peatlands affected by permafrost loss42–45. As frozen ground thaws it collapses, 
forming bogs and fens. Where this subsidence increases hydrologic connectivity, as at 
Stordalen, it can create a progression from ombrotrophic bogs to minerotrophic fens. 
A similar successional shift from bogs dominated by Sphagnum  spp. to tall sedge fens 
has been observed in other northern peatlands42,43,46,47. The uncertainty surrounding 
the extent and characteristics of wetland formation from permafrost thaw is a critical 
limitation to modelling and understanding carbon–climate feedbacks48,49. Improved 
characterization of post-thaw microbial communities and carbon transformation",ts/C processing.pdf,6

Geochemistry.  Across the thaw chronosequence, porewater CH 4 and CO 2 meas -
urements and their 13C isotopic composition were sampled as described previ -
ously28. The δ13C-CH 4 is affected by the δ13C-CO 2, because of the use or production 
of CO 2 during CH 4 generation, so the isotopic fractionation factor is used to report 
the isotopic separation of CH 4 and carbon dioxide50. The α C value reports the 
effective fractionation of C in CH 4, as the δ13C-CH 4 relative to source material  
represented by δ13C-CO 2. The effective fractionation factor of carbon in the  
porewater CH 4 relative to CO 2 (αC) was calculated as described previously33,50.

in 2012. Metagenome sequencing was performed for 2011 and 2012 using 100 ng

DNA samples, libraries were created using 1 ng of DNA with the Nextera XT DNA 
Sample Preparation Kit (Illumina). 2012 libraries were sequenced on 1/12th of an

involved in metabolic pathways examined in the manuscript, as well as the entire 
CDS regions of Ca . ‘ Acidiflorens’ , Ca. ‘Methanoflorens’ and AD3 (Supplementary

"residues to leucine (due to identical masses). In order to calculate the false  
discovery rate (FDR), a parallel search of a decoy protein database was conducted 
by using the (-tda 1) parameter of MSGFPlus during the indexing and searching  
steps of the targeted database. After conducting the searches, the FDR was  calculated as: FDR(t ) = #DecoyPSMs at (t )/#TargetPSMs at (t ), where (t ) is the 
highest Q value that gives a FDR of  ≤ 1%, and #DecoyPSMs and #TargetPSMs are 
the numbers of Decoy and Target Peptide-Spectrum Matches (PSM), respectively, 
at that Q -value threshold. Only PSMs with Q  ≤ (t = 0.0145) were considered in 
the results of this study. The maximum precursor mass tolerance allowed during 
the searches was specified by the (-t 20 ppm) parameter for parent mass tolerance 
and the (-ti ‘-1,2’) parameter for isotope error range. Trypsin was specified as 
the digestion method (-e 1) and only full tryptic digestion was allowed (-ntt 2).",ts/C processing.pdf,8
"and the (-ti ‘-1,2’) parameter for isotope error range. Trypsin was specified as 
the digestion method (-e 1) and only full tryptic digestion was allowed (-ntt 2). 
Minimum and maximum peptide lengths to consider were 6 and 50, respectively. 
Minimum and maximum precursor charges to consider were 2 and 5, respectively. 
For each spectral scan, only the PSMs with the highest MSGF score (-n 1) were 
considered for subsequent analyses.
The detection of a unique peptide in at least one sample was considered  
evidence of expression of a specific enzyme. A specific pathway was designated as 
expressed when at least one enzyme from a pathway was detected in the metap-
roteome. Further, that enzyme had to be encoded in a genome where >50% of 
genomes in the 97% ANI genome cluster encoded all steps of that pathway. Only 
a very small number of proteins (< 1%) were detected where the sequence of that 
protein was 100% identical to a protein from a different ANI genome cluster.",ts/C processing.pdf,8
"a very small number of proteins (< 1%) were detected where the sequence of that 
protein was 100% identical to a protein from a different ANI genome cluster.
The limited number of proteins detected for the fen hydrolysers is likely a  
consequence of the diversity and complexity of the fen community, and the variety 
of proteins produced, compared to the palsa and bog. The metaproteomes were 
searched against a targeted protein database containing only those sequences pre -
dicted from the MAGs. Peptide-spectrum matching requires 100% matches, which 
means that variations in sequence due to population heterogeneity/diversity, which 
is greatest in the fen (Fig.  1; Extended Data Fig. 2), are not captured, reducing 
the number of successful matches. Our approach is conservative following the 
genome-centric focus, and used purely to show that the populations of interest

 1    INTRODUCTION 
Soil is inhabited by an enormous diversity of microorganisms
which  consist  mostly  of  bacteria,  fungi,  archaea,  protists  and
viruses,  collectively  called  the  soil  microbiomes.  Soil
microbiomes  are  essential  to  soil  nitrogen  supply  and  crop  N
uptake  through  their  active  involvement  in  driving  the
biogeochemical  N  cycle[1] and  plant  N  acquisition  in
agroecosystems[2]. Plants take up N as ammonium and nitrate,
and  small  molecules  of  organic  N,  the  availability  of  which
depends on multiple N transformation processes mediated by
soil  microbes.  These  transformations  are  often  depicted  as  a",ts/Nitrogen use.pdf,1
"and  small  molecules  of  organic  N,  the  availability  of  which
depends on multiple N transformation processes mediated by
soil  microbes.  These  transformations  are  often  depicted  as  a
sequence  of  six  distinct  processes  that  proceed  in  an  orderly
fashion:  dinitrogen  gas  is  first  fixed  to  ammonia,  which  is
assimilated  into  organic  N  (biomass)  by  plants  and
microorganisms.  The  degradation  of  organic  N
(ammonification)  releases  ammonium,  which  is  subsequently
oxidized  to  nitrate  through  nitrification  (NH4+ →  NO2– →
NO3–)  and  eventually  converted  back  to  N2 through

"2.1    Manipulation of soil microbial N cycling
processes for NUE improvement
Among the six N cycling processes, N fixation, immobilization
and  DNRA  are  responsible  for  N  retention  in  soils,  while
ammonification  and  nitrification  supply  NH 4+ and  NO 3–
substrates  to  crops,  respectively.  In  contrast,  nitrification
coupled  with  denitrification,  anammox  and  denitrification
processes largely contribute to N losses. Balance of N retention
and loss determines N availability for crop uptake and thereby
crop  NUE [1].  The  increasing  knowledge  on  microbial
mechanisms  of  N  cycle  in  recent  years  is  paving  the  way  for
steering  microbial  N  cycling  processes  for  higher  NUE.

"soils, has recently become the intensive research initiatives for
reducing  N  losses [8],  as  nitrification  greatly  contributes  to

ammonia  oxidizing  archaea  (AOA),  and  newly  discovered
complete  ammonia  oxidizers  (comammox  Nitrospira )[10,11],  is
the first and a rate-limiting step in nitrification, which convertsimmobile NH 4+ to mobile anion NO 3–, causing massive losses
of N from agricultural system. Nitrification contributes to the
production  of  N 2O  as  the  intermediate  products  of  ammonia
oxidation or through fueling denitrification [8]. A few strategies
have  been  proposed  to  reduce  N  loss  and  pollution  from

"although the precise mechanism of this inhibition has not yet
been  clarified.  These  NIs  appear  not  to  be  effective  toward
AOA,  possibly  due  to  a  structural  difference  of  the  AmoB
subunit in these organisms[12]. For example, DMPP effectively
inhibits activity of AOB but has minor effect on AOA across a
range  of  soil  types[13,14].  Comammox  bacteria  which
coordinate  the  complete  conversion  of  ammonia  into  nitrate
was shown to be inhibited by allylthiourea, a copper chelator as
well[11]. In addition, the inhibitory effect of NIs on nitrification
and  N2O  emission  is  dependent  on  soil  pH[14].  Autotrophic
nitrification  rates  and  N2O  emissions  in  alkaline  soils  can  be
efficiently inhibited by the application of 1% DMPP[15], but this
inhibitory  effect  was  not  observed  in  acidic  soils[16].  The

dominate  ammonia  oxidation  in  acidic  and  N-deficient  soils

Thus,  future  application  of  NIs  should  consider  the  matching
of  NIs  with  soil  properties  and  the  dominant  nitrifiers  to
achieve a high NUE with lower environmental costs.
Manipulating soil properties by amendments (e.g., biochar and
lime)  can  improve  NUE  through  indirectly  regulating  N-
cycling functional microbes. For example, biochar amendment
can  stimulate  both  nitrification  and  denitrification  processes,

In  contrast  to  nitrification  and  denitrification  causing  N  loss,
biological N2 fixation (BNF) and DNRA are beneficial to soil N
supply and retention by assimilating N into microbial biomass
and  converting  mobile  NO3– to  immobile  NH4+[29].  It  is
estimated  that  NUE  increases  exponentially  with  increasing
levels of BNF in soils but decreases drastically with increasing
levels  of  applied  synthetic  N  fertilizers[30].  Fertilization  exerts
significant effects on activity of diazotrophs and DNRA-related
microbes,  and  therefore  affects  the  rates  of  the  two  processes.
Long-term application of inorganic fertilizers strongly reduced
(~50%)  BNF[13],  and  markedly  suppressed  diazotrophic
abundance  and  nitrogenase  activity[31].  However,  this  can  be
largely  alleviated  by  the  combined  application  of  organic

and nrfA genes (encoding enzymes of DNRA)[34], while it can
be  improved  by  straw  return  in  paddy  soils  despite  the
variation between soil types[35]. Therefore, enhancing BNF and
DNRA processes through optimizing fertilization management
(e.g.,  growing  legumes  with  manure  application  or  straw
return)  will  contribute  greatly  to  increased  NUE  in
agroecosystems.

N2 fixation  of  faba  bean  can  be  promoted  by  intercropped

"soil  (>  95%)  is  contained  in  dead  organic  matter  as  complex
insoluble  polymers  such  as  proteins,  nucleic  acids  and  chitin,
considerable amounts of N taken up by plants are derived from
mineralization of soil organic matter[61]. Conversely, mineral N
fertilizer  applied  to  the  soil  and  soluble  nutrients  mineralized
by decomposition are liable to be converted to organic form as
microbial biomass. Soil microbiota therefore represent a large
N and P nutrient pool in agricultural soils, but meanwhile they
compete for available N with plant, depending on the soil C:N
stoichiometric  ratio[62].  The  net  flow  of  N  compounds  in  the
soil  are  thus  interactively  regulated  by  microbial  N  use

facilitate  plant  growth  by  increasing  N  supply,  solubilizing
minerals,  and  secreting  phytohormones[67].  In  addition,  N
cycling  in  agroecosystems  is  heavily  dependent  on  AMF
present in the soil[68]. AMF can develop symbiotic relationship
with  70%–90%  of  plants,  including  cereals  and  legumes[69],
thus  increasing  their  ability  to  acquire  N  and  influence  the
availability  of  soil  mineral  N  through  modifying  N-cycling
microbes[70].  PGPR  and  AMF  are  therefore  the  most  widely
applied  microbial  inoculants  in  agriculture.  However,  their
efficiencies  vary  under  different  soil  conditions  and  are
influenced by multiple factors such as fertilization, tillage and

Numerous  studies  have  shown  that  the  diversity  of  soil
bacterial  taxa,  keystone  phylotypes,  and  even  bacterial  and
fungal community composition, are predictors for crop yield in
various  agricultural  ecosystems[57,73,74].  Abundance  of  kinless
hubs  within  soil  microbial  networks  are  positively  and
significantly correlated with the abundance of functional genes
involving in C fixation, C degradation, C methanol, N cycling,
P  cycling  and  S  cycling,  which  highlighted  the  importance  of
soil  biodiversity  in  maintaining  ecosystem  function  in
croplands[75].  It  has  been  reported  that  ultrahigh  yield  paddy
soil contains more taxa with N metabolism functions and more

 3    CONCLUDING REMARKS 
Overall,  the  rapid  advances  in  modern  molecular  techniques
open  up  powerful  avenues  for  deciphering  mechanisms
underlying  soil  microbiome-mediated  N  cycling  and  its
agricultural  significance.  Soil  microbiomes  can  strongly
influence soil N supply and crop N uptake with multiple ways,Jingjing PENG et al.  Linking microbiomes to crop N use efficiency 339",ts/Nitrogen use.pdf,6
"including:  (1)  directly  participating  in  N  transformation
process  and  controlling  N  availability  and  losses;  (2)  closely
associating  with  plant  and  facilitating  plant  nutrient  uptake
and  growth  promotion;  and  (3)  serving  as  the  large  N  and  P
nutrient pool and the mediator of soil food web and energy flux
in  soil.  Although  a  range  of  practices,  such  as  NIs,  soil
amendments,  and  bioaugmentation  of  PGPR  and  AMF,  have
been  adopted  to  improve  crop  NUE  and  yield  in
agroecosystems, future research needs to further elucidate the
mechanisms  by  which  genomic  diversity  drives  variation  in

Introduction
Most crops grow under suboptimal conditions where they 
frequently encounter different combinations of abiotic and/
or biotic stresses (Bray et al., 2000). These stresses are a major 
hurdle in maximizing crop yield and thus remain a constant 
threat to global food security. Plant response to these combi-
natorial stresses is complex as it is not simply an additive ef-",ts/erac491.pdf,0
"hurdle in maximizing crop yield and thus remain a constant 
threat to global food security. Plant response to these combi-
natorial stresses is complex as it is not simply an additive ef-
fect of individual stresses but rather has a reduced or enhanced 
susceptibility to biotic or abiotic stress. This is because com-
bined stresses are largely controlled by different signaling path-
ways which often act antagonistically and engage in crosstalk 
(Asselbergh et al., 2008; Atkinson and Urwin, 2012; Suzuki 
et al., 2014). It has been found that abiotic stresses strongly af-
fect the biotic stress response by altering the plant–microbial  interactions in a dynamic manner (see Saijo and Loo, 2020). 
For instance, a positive regulator of drought stress (calmod-
ulin-binding transcription activator) negatively regulates the

gae DC3000 in Solanum lycopersicum (Li et al., 2014). Similarly,",ts/erac491.pdf,0

Nakaminami et al., 2018). Among various abiotic stresses, there 
has been a rising concern over mineral nutrient depletion in 
most agricultural soils (Alewell et al., 2020). It has also been 
established that plants’ response to microbes (both harmful 
and beneficial) gets altered according to their mineral nutrient Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/jxb/advance-article/doi/10.1093/jxb/erac491/6902000 by National Cheng Kung University Library user on 21 March 2023",ts/erac491.pdf,0

interesting to understand how crops prioritize growth versus 
defense and how plants modulate their immune response ac-
cording to nutritional status, especially under soil phosphate 
(Pi) deficiency.
Phosphorus (P) is an essential mineral nutrient for crop 
growth, yield, and performance; however, its availability is lim-
ited due to low solubility and mobility in soil (Vitousek et al., 
2010; Johnston et al., 2014; Oldroyd and Leyser, 2020; Ma et al., 
2021). Lack of sufficient P fertilizers is anticipated to affect 
the availability of food and feed in the future (Alewell et al., 
2020; Oldroyd and Leyser, 2020). Also, P deficiency cannot be 
alleviated entirely even with external supplementation with 
P fertilizers as most of the applied P is quickly precipitated

"alleviated entirely even with external supplementation with 
P fertilizers as most of the applied P is quickly precipitated 
to form metal–cation complexes with soil minerals, and soil 
microbes incorporate Pi in the organic matter. Consequently, 
only a fraction of the P becomes available for root uptake in 
the form of plant utilizable orthophosphate (Pi; van de Wiel 
et al., 2016). T o ensure adequate Pi supply, plants invoke various 
adaptive strategies for enhanced acquisition, efficient utiliza-
tion, and remobilization regulated by comprehensive transcrip-
tomic changes (Rouached et al., 2010; Das et al., 2022). These 
strategies include root system architecture (RSA) remodeling 
(López-Bucio et al., 2003; Lynch et al., 2022), induced expres-
sion of Pi transport genes (Raghothama, 2000; Nussaume et al.,

2011; Wang et al., 2018), and exudation of Pi-solubilizing sub-
stances such as organic acids which act as anion exchangers 
that release the tightly bound Pi (Mehra et al., 2017; Bhadouria 
and Giri, 2021; Isidra-Arellano et al., 2021; Panchal et al., 2021). 
Furthermore, plants also engage with rhizosphere microbiome 
and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) to improve Pi acqui-
sition (Hiruma et al., 2016; Castrillo et al, 2017; Finkel et al, 
2019; Isidra-Arellano et al, 2021). These adaptations involving 
morphological, physiological, metabolic, and transcriptomic 
changes in response to Pi deprivation are collectively known 
as the phosphate starvation response (PSR; Rubio et al., 2001;

In general, there seems to be a profound influence of biotic 
and abiotic stresses on each other in the manifestation of stress 
responses. It has been suggested that the genotypes having a 
superior response to abiotic stress may have a compromised 
biotic defense response (Demmig-Adams et al., 2013). How-
ever, this understanding is fragmentary and the complete 
picture is still unclear (Atkinson and Urwin, 2012). While in 
specific cases, abiotic stress provides enhanced biotic stress re-
sistance to plants, for others plants prioritize their response to

The molecular intersection between these combinatorial stress 
responses and their regulatory principles are only beginning 
to be uncovered through recent studies (see Saijo and Loo, 
2020). There have been gaps in the current understanding of the molecular players involved in the crosstalk for mitigating 
Pi stress along with plant microbial interactions. In this review, 
we attempt to develop a comprehensive view of plant biotic 
interactions influenced by plant P status. Different key players, 
their crosstalk, and their involvement in molecular mechanisms

Biotic interactions to mitigate phosphate deficiency 
stress
T o improve Pi uptake, plant roots form symbiotic associations 
with the soil microbiome which are greatly dependent on the 
host Pi status (Fig. 1). Pi deficiency conditions trigger mi-
crobial associations, while Pi-sufficient plants restrict interac-
tions with soil microbes (Kobae et al., 2016; Campos-Soriano 
et al., 2020). These associations are highly regulated through 
the activation of the PSR system (Oldroyd and Leyser, 2020).

PHR1, a MYB-type coiled-coil (MYB-CC) transcription 
factor (TF) initially identified from Arabidopsis, is the core 
TF that regulates the PSR transcriptome (Riechmann et al., 
2000; Zhou et al., 2008). A part of the PHR-driven P-starva-
tion induced (PSI) genes is also involved in initiation, devel-
opment, and maintenance of root microbial interactions (Das 
et al., 2022). In Arabidopsis, it has been shown that PHR1 
could directly activate microbiome-enhanced responses to 
limited P conditions; however, at the same time it represses 
a subset of genes involved in microbially driven immune 
system outputs (Castrillo et al., 2017; Bai et al., 2022). Fur-

munication exists between the plant immune system and the 
root microbiome in the rhizosphere that results in an induced 
systemic resistance (ISR) in the host plant (Berendsen et al., 
2012). This takes place primarily through root exudates, and 
plants are known to secrete up to 40% of the photosyntheti-
cally fixed carbon as exudates (Walker et al., 2003; Bais et al.,

solubilizing phosphates as well as in regulating microbes 
that could interfere with the Pi uptake through the release 
of isoflavonoids, protons, and cell wall-degrading enzymes 
besides organic acids (Sasse et al., 2018). Also, the aromatic

Table 1 lists a few selected examples where rhizobium and/

tage to the host crop species in terms of enhanced Pi up-

However, in this process of establishing the symbiotic asso-

for plant survival. The plant innate immune system involving

Tang et al., 2022). In the following sections, the mechanisms 
involved in plant–microbial symbiosis for Pi and their associ-
ated trade-offs are discussed.
Rhizobial associations for phosphate acquisition
During Pi starvation, plants modulate their immune response to 
alter the root microbiome community structure for their own 
advantage. However, it is not clear how plants form a selective 
microbial assemblage in response to nutritional cues (Bakker 
et al., 2018). Castrillo et al. (2017) demonstrated using a syn-
thetic bacterial community which competes with the plant for 
nutrients exerting Pi deficiency, that PSR is induced through 
the activity of PHR1, which in turn negatively regulated immu-
nity in Arabidopsis. It has also been observed that some of the

"the activity of PHR1, which in turn negatively regulated immu-
nity in Arabidopsis. It has also been observed that some of the 
members of the commensal root microbiome facilitate nutrient 
acquisition. For example, Colletotrichum tofeldiae could facilitate 
Pi acquisition through direct delivery of Pi to roots, while many 
of its closely related species are plant pathogens. It is interesting 
to note that the components controlling the immune response 
to nutrient status regulate these commensal associations. It has 
been shown that C. tofeldiae infection and rhizosphere bacterial 
communities are dependent on PHR1-regulated signaling, sug-
gesting a common component regulating both commensal asso-
ciation and response to nutrient status, particularly Pi (Hiruma 
et al., 2016; Castrillo et al., 2017; Oldroyd and Leyser, 2020).

This symbiosis is influenced by the biosynthesis of tryptophan-
derived secondary metabolites such as indole glucosinolates 
(Hiruma et al., 2016; Frerigmann et al., 2021).In brief, Pi status in plants is monitored by the PSR which 
determines the fate of the plant biotic interaction. This involves 
a highly regulated process of sensing and response. Under suf-
ficient Pi growth conditions, intracellular levels of inositol 
polyphosphates (InsPs) are high. InsP binds to the SPX do-
main (Syg1/Pho81/XprI) found in various proteins involved 
in regulating Pi homeostasis. One group of such protein are 
named SPX proteins because they only contain an SPX do-
main. Under high Pi growth conditions, InsP promotes the 
interaction between SPX and the PHR1, inhibiting its activity 
as a TF (Puga et al., 2014; Wild et al., 2016). In Pi deficiency, the 
levels of InsPs, especially InsP8, becomes low, and thus could",ts/erac491.pdf,3

as a TF (Puga et al., 2014; Wild et al., 2016). In Pi deficiency, the 
levels of InsPs, especially InsP8, becomes low, and thus could 
not facilitate binding of SPXs with PHR. Incidentally, InsP8 is 
generated from its precursor, InsP7, through the kinase activity 
of VIH1 and VIH2, which is allosterically regulated under Pi-
sufficient conditions allowing InsP8–SPX–PHR complex for-
mation (Laha et al., 2015; Gu et al., 2017; J. Dong et al., 2019; 
Zhu et al., 2019; Satheesh et al., 2022). SPX proteins are even-
tually degraded, allowing PHRs to activate PSR (J. Dong et al., 
2019; Ruan et al., 2019). However, upon Pi starvation, how 
the levels of InP become low and PHR1–SPX dissociation 
takes place is not completely understood (Motte and Beeck-

turn suppresses a PAMP-triggered immunity (PTI) receptor 
via FERONIA, a PTI modulator known to enhance pathogen 
resistance (Tang et al., 2022). This PHR1–RALF–FERONIA 
axis suppresses immunity in order to facilitate colonization by

This was also reiterated by Castrillo et al. (2017) where, in 
Arabidopsis, PHR1 and its paralog, PHL1, were also found to 
repress the immune response under Pi depletion. This implies 
that plants find it difficult to cope with dual stress, namely 
nutrient starvation and pathogenic infection at the same 
time. During Pi depletion, plants suppress immunity through 
PHR1 and associate with microbes that help in nutrient up-
take (Motte and Beeckman, 2017; Oldroyd and Leyser, 2020). 
However, our understanding of the crosstalk between mutu-
alism and immunity with mediator molecules playing an im-
portant role is limited. A study showed that under Pi-sufficient

growth under Pi sufficiency by partially suppressing reactive 
oxygen species (ROS) and enhancing symbiont colonization. 
However, upon Pi deficiency, it becomes deleterious, causing 
leaf cell death and impaired photosynthesis (Morcillo et al.,

This notion is supported by a recent study where an enhanced 
defense against the fungal pathogen Fusarium oxysporum was es-
tablished by specific families of the rhizosphere microbiome in 
common beans (Phaseolus vulgaris; Mendes et al., 2018). How-
ever, it is interesting to note that Pi-starved Arabidopsis roots 
establish a beneficial relationship with C. tofieldiae, prioritizing 
root growth and Pi metabolism, but activate a defense response 
under Pi sufficiency. This implies that the plant response to 
microbes varies with their Pi status. In addition, a study dem-
onstrated that Arabidopsis, when inoculated with a synthetic 
bacterial community (SynCom), induces the PSR and medi-
ates systemic plant immunity, controlled by the master regu-
lator, PHR1 (Castrillo et al., 2017; Rolfe et al., 2019). If this

holds true for other plant species, then PSR induced by the 
ISR-eliciting microbiota could enhance the biosynthesis of 
strigolactone (SL) which in turn facilitates the recruitment of 
AMF to plant roots (Cameron et al., 2013; Rolfe et al., 2019). 
Thus, during the course of evolution, PSR has been found to 
be coupled to the immune response, maintaining a delicate 
balance between Pi status and innate immunity (Motte and 
Beeckman, 2017).
Symbiotic associations for phosphate acquisition
T o support survival, stress resistance, and performance, plants 
also engage in AM symbiosis, where fungal colonization is 
promoted under soil Pi deficiency conditions. About 80% of  
vascular plant families are colonized by mycorrhiza (Wang et al.,",ts/erac491.pdf,4
"also engage in AM symbiosis, where fungal colonization is

vascular plant families are colonized by mycorrhiza (Wang et al., 
2017) and acquire Pi through the fungi, an association which is ~469 million years old (Redecker et al., 2000). Interestingly, fungi 
provide wide coverage of the soil, extending between 25 cm and 
a few meters for efficient Pi mobilization, and could directly 
transfer Pi to the host root cells due to endophytic colonization 
(Chan et al., 2021; Poirer et al., 2022). Crops such as maize (Zea 
mays) depend ~33% more on mycorrhizal association than on 
root hairs for enhanced Pi acquisition (Ma et al., 2021). In addi-
tion to facilitating Pi uptake, AMF have been reported to induce 
systemic resistance that suppresses a wide range of plant pests 
and diseases in the host (Jung et al., 2012; Cameron et al., 2013).

the mycorrhiza played an important role in providing resistance 
to A. solani which upon Pi sufficiency was possibly attenuated, 
manifesting disease symptoms. However, mycorrhization turns 
out to be costly to the host as the fungi depend on its photosyn-
thetically fixed carbon and compromise its immunity to facilitate

role in integrating P status with establishment of AM symbi-

osis has became increasingly apparent recently through several 
studies. In addition, it also serves as a hub for integrating inputs

promoters controlling hormone signaling pathways [ethylene,

endogenous and exogenous signals with precise Pi sensing.
Nexus between components controlling phosphate 
status and immunity
Crops experience a plethora of biotic stresses in natural and ag-
ricultural ecosystems. While Pi deficiency limits plant growth 
and development, pathogen infection and insect herbivory ac-
count for major losses in crop productivity (Khan et al., 2017;

Pi homeostasis and immunity are linked, Pi status can directly 
influence the plant immune response through PSR involving 
common molecular players of signaling pathways (Fig. 2). Re-
cent studies revealed that the Pi level (InsP8) serves as a signal, 
and its accumulation represses the expression of genes involved 
in defense response. For instance, high Pi status weakens the 
plant defense against foliar pathogens in rice (Campos-Soriano 
et al., 2020). This inverse relationship between Pi availability 
and defense response was also evident in the case of cotton

"and defense response was also evident in the case of cotton 
(Gossypium hirsutum) where Pi deficiency leads to resistance 
against Verticillium dahliae (Luo et al., 2021). Pi deficiency can 
directly impact the immune response through the induction of 
phytohormones such as SA and JA, which further mediate the 
biosynthesis of defense-related secondary metabolites (Chan 
et al., 2021). Low Pi also triggers PSI gene expression regulated 
by the TFs PHR1/PHL1, which directly regulate the expres-
sion of SA-responsive gene expression (Castrillo et al., 2017).
The soil microbiome could elicit ISR in the host plant

PHRs form the nexus between Pi homeostasis and the plant

Pi-deficient conditions, PHR1 has been shown to negatively 
regulate the SA-mediated immune response. Repression of 
SA-responsive genes by PHR1 was shown through phr1 and 
phr1phl1 Arabidopsis mutant studies (Castrillo et al., 2017). This 
corroborates well with the fact that, in order to associate with 
the root microbiome, plants have to compromise their immunity 
to alleviate low Pi conditions. Through the molecular analysis of 
phr1-1 mutant, it has also been found that the activation of the 
JA signaling pathway is partially controlled by PHR1 under Pi-
deficient conditions. In rice, OsPHR2, which is expressed mainly 
in roots and is involved in Pi-dependent alteration of root archi-

Among the Pi transporters, PHT1, belonging to a multigene 
family, utilizes the proton motive force across the plasma mem-
brane to transport the Pi anion into the cytosol (Liu et al.,

JA as a critical component in Pi deficiency adaptations 
and plant immunity
Phytohormones play a primary role in mediating signaling 
between environmental stimuli (biotic/abiotic) and the tran-
scriptomic response for acclimation (Chan et al., 2021). They 
orchestrate the interaction between biotic and abiotic stresses 
by exerting either an antagonistic or a synergistic effect (Assel-
bergh et al., 2008; Atkinson and Urwin, 2012). Under varying 
Pi status, crops respond differently to biotic stresses. In this re-
gard, phytohormones such as SLs, SA, JA, and ethylene play a 
critical role (Chan et al., 2021). Pi starvation represses the level 
of GA and cytokinin (CK), while elevating the level of ab-
scisic acid (ABA) in Arabidopsis and barley roots (Vysotskaya 
et al., 2016) and of ethylene (Chapin and Jones, 2009; Chiou

"scisic acid (ABA) in Arabidopsis and barley roots (Vysotskaya 
et al., 2016) and of ethylene (Chapin and Jones, 2009; Chiou 
and Lin, 2011). In studying the nutrient–immunity trade-off, 
crosstalk between these hormones seems critical. While SLs are 
an important phytohormone regulating PSR and rhizosphere 
signaling molecules, plants trigger systemic defense 
responses involving SA and JA when exposed to pathogenic 
infection (Robert-Seilaniantz et al., 2011; Pieterse et al., 2012; 
Wang et al., 2021). SA mediates defense against biotrophic 
pathogens such as downy mildew, whereas JA mediates im-
mune response against insect herbivores and necrotrophic 
pathogens. All these phytohormones directly or indirectly play 
an important role in shaping the root microbiome (Lebeis, 
2014; Carvalhais et al., 2015). GAs regulates AM association in

accordance with the Pi status. Using solanaceous model sys-
tems, high Pi was shown to cause an increase in GA levels 
in the mycorrhizal roots, leading to an inhibitory effect on 
the AM symbiosis (Nouri et al., 2021). Similarly, in rice, a GA 
receptor, GIBBERELLIN INSENSITIVE DWARF1 (GID1), 
was shown to perceive GA which then interacts with a rice 
DELLA ortholog, SLR1, causing its degradation by polyu-
biquitination (Yu  et al., 2014). However, high activity of GA2 
oxidase keeps the relative levels of GA low under low Pi con-
ditions due to which DELLA protein remains protected from 
degradation (Nouri et al., 2021). A repressed level of GA leads 
to DELLA protein accumulation, which in turn promotes AM 
symbiosis (Wang et al., 2022). In addition to these, a crosstalk 
also exists among SA, JA, and ethylene which provides resist-
ance against pathogens and herbivory (Yang et al., 2019).",ts/erac491.pdf,8

Interestingly, traits observed in Pi-starved plants such as 
growth retardation and anthocyanin accumulation, are also 
found during JA induction, suggesting a link between the two 
signaling pathways (Li et al., 2018). Recently, a rapid rise in the 
level of endogenous JA along with the genes involved in its 
biosynthesis (LOX2, AOS1, and AOS2) was shown within 1 h 
of transfer of rice seedlings to Pi-deficient media (Tao et al.,

tered exudate profile that would allow rhizobial associations

higher levels of JA led to enhanced defense response to insect herbivory (Khan et al., 2016; Kong et al., 2021). It has been 
indicated that the induction of the JA signaling pathway by 
Pi deficiency was partially controlled by PHR1. Studies with 
the phr1 mutants found a delayed activation of the JA signal-
ing pathway but it was not abolished completely (Khan et al., 
2016), indicating the possible role of other signaling compo-
nents such as InsPs. InsP5 and InsP8 have been known to act as 
co-activators of the JA signaling pathway by binding to the co-
receptor complex, COI1–JAZ (Sheard et al., 2010; Laha et al.,

to necrotrophic and hemibiotrophic fungal infections. In the 
absence of any infection, plants grown under high Pi supply 
displayed an induced expression of genes involved in SA- and 
JA-dependent signaling pathways. However, in the event of 
pathogen infection, these plants showed opposite regulation in 
the two branches of the JA signaling pathway (the ERF and 
MYC branch). This was indicated by an enhanced expression

Pi starvation is accompanied by an increase in sugar accu-
mulation, predominantly sucrose and starch, in the leaves of

vation responses and sugar homeostasis (Karthikeyan et al., 
2007; Hammond and White, 2008; Rouached et al., 2010; Yan

is exuded and plays an important role in engaging beneficial 
microbes to deliver Pi from non-utilizable sources (Hennion

"porters carry sugars to the plant cells containing the arbuscule,

across the peri-arbuscular membrane towards the AM (Hen-

and towards the rhizosphere-associated microbes mainly takes 
place through SWEET transporters (Chen et al., 2010; Chen 
et al., 2014; Hennion et al., 2019). SWEET transporters could 
be regarded as a core component for Pi starvation-induced 
mycorrhizal association. Besides their role in mycorrhizal as-
sociation, SWEETs have been implicated in plant response to 
pathogens (Yamada et al., 2016; Hennion et al., 2019). Restrict-
ing sugar uptake is one of the strategies plants employ against 
microbial infection and is regulated by sugar transporters. For 
instance, AtSWEET2 and AtSWEET11 have been shown to 
restrict Pythium irregulare and Plasmodiophora brassicae infec-

Thus, the relevance of SWEET in Pi starvation-induced

dent through these studies. However, the clear understanding 
of their potential role in the crosstalk between the Pi stress and 
biotic stress, their metabolic signatures, and their regulatory 
principles still needs to be elucidated.

needs to be explored further.
Concluding remarks and future 
perspectives
There is substantial evidence that abiotic stresses modulate the ex-
pression of plant defense and pathogen virulence genes (Rizhsky 
et al., 2004). Plants prioritize and balance resource allocation be-
tween growth and defense response as responding to stresses can 
prove costly in terms of growth and crop yield (Tian et al., 2003).

"tween growth and defense response as responding to stresses can 
prove costly in terms of growth and crop yield (Tian et al., 2003). 
Depletion of P and nitrogen triggers defense responses at molec-
ular and biochemical levels in plants (Zarattini et al., 2021). In the 
case of Pi depletion, PHR1 is reportedly known to directly in-
tegrate PSR and plant immunity, also activating a microbiome-
enhanced response. Very recently, Tang et al. (2022) demonstrated 
that Pi starvation and plant immunity are balanced through the 
RALF–FERONIA module in Arabidopsis. Additionally, Cas-
trillo et al. (2017) demonstrated the role of PHR1 in suppress-
ing SA-induced response under Pi starvation while activating 
JA-responsive genes including those mediating the biosynthesis of

"that PHR1 shuts a part of but not the entire immune response 
system. Arabidopsis, unlike rice and Lotus japonicus, is a non-mycor-
rhizal plant, and whether this immune suppression theory in Ara-
bidopsis applies to mycorrhizal-driven responses is something that 
still needs to be explored. Furthermore, soil Pi uptake and its distri-
bution within the plant take place mainly through PHT1. Some of 
these genes are also known to be regulated in response to beneficial 
microbes, especially AMF . However, these fungus-inducible PHT1  
genes such as soybean PT10 and PT11 seem to be lacking in non-
mycorrhizal plant such as Arabidopsis. Most of the PHT1 trans-
porter genes have been reported to show mild or no response to 
a beneficial endophytic fungus, Piriformospora indica, irrespective of the Pi status (Sisaphaithong et al., 2012; Tamura et al., 2012). These 
studies indicate that there are different immune system outputs for",ts/erac491.pdf,10
"studies indicate that there are different immune system outputs for 
different biotic interactions modulated by the Pi status. In addi-
tion, experiencing long-term abiotic stress can cause a weakening 
of the immune response subsequently causing pathogen infection 
(Amtmann et al., 2008; Mittler and Blumwald, 2010; Atkinson and 
Urwin, 2012). Further, a recent study in Arabidopsis demonstrated 
that plants with high Pi status exhibited resistance to infections 
by fungal pathogens. This suggests that the plant modulates dif-
ferent defense response circuitry in accordance with the nutritional 
clues for varying biotic encounters such as fungal, bacterial, and 
insect herbivory. The understanding of the direct coupling of PSR 
to the immune response opens up new avenues to deploy resist-
ance strategies in crops. Also, it would be interesting to explore a 
similar coupling of the starvation response of other minerals with 
plant immunity. For instance, the NITROGEN LIMITATION",ts/erac491.pdf,10
"ance strategies in crops. Also, it would be interesting to explore a 
similar coupling of the starvation response of other minerals with 
plant immunity. For instance, the NITROGEN LIMITATION 
ADAPTION ( NLA) gene, having an important role in nitrogen 
limitation responses in Arabidopsis (Peng et al., 2007), also mediates 
degradation of Pi transporters to maintain Pi homeostasis (Lin et al., 
2013; Park et al., 2014; Y ue et al., 2017). A recent study revealed that 
nla mutants show resistance to necrotrophic and hemibiotrophic 
fungal infections through the enhanced accumulation of SA, JA, 
and camalexin levels in Arabidopsis. Several independent studies 
suggest the role of NLA in regulating adaptation under nitrogen 
limitation, PSR, and immunity (Peng et al., 2007; Val-T orregrosa 
et al., 2022b). This indicates the existence of a crosstalk between

"et al., 2022b). This indicates the existence of a crosstalk between 
various nutrient signaling pathways and immune responses in 
plants. Our understanding of this crosstalk would help to devise 
strategies to improve crop resilience under a natural environment 
where nutrient deficiency is coupled with other stresses especially 
biotic stresses. Though a holistic approach would be required to 
mitigate such a situation, there are instances where manipulating 
a single gene or a combination of key genes was demonstrated 
to enhance yield (Delhaize et al., 2009; Baker et al., 2015; Cho 
et al., 2021). A majority of such studies have been conducted in 
model plants; however, similar studies need to be conducted in 
other crop species as well which would allow engineering cul-
tivars, for instance with more efficient utilization of available Pi 
and enhanced Pi acquisition strategies with the defense response. 
These require a mechanistic understanding of stress responses and",ts/erac491.pdf,10
"and enhanced Pi acquisition strategies with the defense response. 
These require a mechanistic understanding of stress responses and 
utilization of stress acclimation networks. Several key molecular 
components including TFs, phosphate transporters, defense phy-
tohormones, miRNA, and sugar transporters have been identified. 
Many of these genes have been characterized for a key role in 
low Pi tolerance and modulating plant immunity (Fig. 2) through 
either overexpression or suppression. Some of these genes encod-
ing SWEET, WRKY TFs, and the OPDA have been suggested 
to have a new role in the nexus between Pi status and immunity 
which could be explored further. Attempts have also been made 
to determine their positive effects on Pi acquisition and/or utili-
zation efficiency (López-Arredondo et al., 2014). In the context of 
the present article, there could be two rational strategies to reduce 
over-reliance on Pi fertilizers; firstly, to ameliorate negative effects",ts/erac491.pdf,10

maintaining Pi homeostasis by mobilizing recalcitrant P in plant. 
In the case of multiple stress responses, attention has to be paid 
to applying strategies that are synergistic to the plant immune re-
sponse. It is highly critical to understand the negative interactions 
of multiple stresses and the complexity involved in stress response 
signaling during stress combination (Suzuki et al., 2014). Targeting 
and utilizing these molecular players through genetic engineering 
approaches, utilizing SynCom, integrating quantitative trait locus 
mapping with other genetic and conventional breeding approaches 
would be the way forward.

"fertilization: (1) buffering capacity of soil organic matter (SOM) and
of clays, (2) increasing crop growth and C input belowground by N
fertilization, (3) acidity localization at the fertilization point, (4) SIClocalization in the sub ‐soil, (5) application of CaO and basic slag
instead of lime, (6) inability of farmers in low income countries to
apply lime. We conclude that our previous estimation of CO
2fluxes
from carbonates by N fertilization (7.5 ×1012g C year‐1) and from
liming of acidic soils (273 ×1012g C year‐1) is possibly an underesti-
mation and consequently, the contribution of SIC to atmospheric
CO 2is more important than previously thought.

ouki, & Kuzyakov, 2018).
SOM and clays buffer the acidity only in soils with pH below 6.5
—the soils without carbonates. The increased belowground C input
by N fertilization can only be of very minor importance because the
portion of belowground allocated C decreases with N availability
(Figure 1) and the soil organic carbon (SOC) in most soils is under
steady state. Consequently, the increase of root biomass by N fertil-
ization is less than that of the shoots, because of decreasing root /
shoot ratio. So, despite root C contributes 2.5 –3.0 times more to the
SOM formation (Rasse, Rumpel, & Dignac, 2005), the relative
increase of root biomass is of minor importance. Further, the root /
shoot ratio will decrease in future because the breeding is mainly
aimed on the grain yield.",ts/Global Change Biology - 2018 - Zamanian - Contribution of soil inorganic carbon to atmospheric CO2 More important than.pdf,0

FIGURE 1 Belowground C allocation by Lolium perenne
depending on N fertilization. The contribution of CO 2assimilated by
plants to SOM formation mentioned by Datta and Mandal (2018) —
about 1/3 of plant ‐assimilated C —is strongly overestimated. We
agree that about 20% –33% of assimilated C will be allocated
belowground by grasses or agricultural cereals (Pausch & Kuzyakov,2018), but: (1) the C input into the soil is much larger than its
contribution to SOM formation, because most of the root ‐derived C
will be decomposed to CO
2, and (2) the portion of assimilated C
strongly decreases with N fertilization. Therefore, only a small partof the belowground allocated C contributes to SOM formation:

According to the review of (Kuzyakov & Domanski, 2000), only 3.5%
(wheat), 2.3% (barley), and 3.7% –4.9% (various grasses) of the plant ‐
assimilated C is incorporated into SOM. From this C incorporated
into SOM, only a delta —the increase ( Δ) of total C input by plants
into the soil by N fertilization —should be considered. This Δis so
marginal that its potential importance disappears against the
backdrop of other factors. Modified from figure 8 of Pausch and

"The initial acidity induced by fertilization is limited to the point
at which fertilizers are applied, but the produced H+ions migrate
easily to the CaCO 3depth and are neutralized with CO 2
production. Furthermore, erosion (common in croplands even in
semi‐arid climates) places the sub ‐soil in contact to the atmo-
sphere and thus to the applied fertilizers. When SIC is present, its
amount is endlessly large compared to the applied N fertilizers
(Figure 2).
CaO and Ca2+‐containing slag are produced by heating CaCO 3
and metal ores, respectively, at temperatures exceeding 800°C.
The production of CaO and basic slag leads to CO 2emission from
CaCO 3, but in a sector other than agriculture. The area amended
with CaO and basic slag is minimal compared to the liming area.
N fertilization in low ‐income countries is very low (see the Nfertilization map: Figure 1 in Zamanian et al., 2018) and, accord-
ingly, less acidification is expected. The annual release of 3.2 –7.9",ts/Global Change Biology - 2018 - Zamanian - Contribution of soil inorganic carbon to atmospheric CO2 More important than.pdf,1

1012g C from SIC as estimated by Perrin, Probst and Probst
(2008) is based on a field trial and direct measurement of NO 3−
and HCO 3−concentrations in surface water. They clearly showed
the correspondence of alkalinity neutralization in surface water
(not soil) with increasing nitrate concentrations. So far, our estima-
tion based on the CaCO 3distribution in soils and N fertilization is
the first approach for a global estimation of CO 2from SIC. Using
more accurate and detailed maps accompanying local measure-
ments will no doubt improve the estimation. Nonetheless, higher

"CO 2fluxes are expected because over ‐fertilization always takes

other than urea (e.g., (NH 4)2SO4, Ca(H 2PO4)2), and mineralization
of animal dung in pastures should also be included. Furthermore,
not only N fertilization, but also global N pollution leads to acidifi-
cation (Averill, Dietze, & Bhatnagar, 2018) and unaccounted CO 2
efflux from CaCO 3. We conclude that, considering the factors
mentioned by Datta and Mandal (2018), our estimation (Zamanian

(7.5×1012g C year−1) and from liming of acidic soils
(273 ×1012g C year−1) as accurate as it can be done to date is
possibly an underestimation.

"(over) fertilization and atmospheric N deposition induce soil acidification, which is neu -
tralized by soil inorganic carbon (SIC; carbonates), and carbon dioxide (CO2) is released 
to the atmosphere. For the first time, the loss of SIC stocks in response to N-induced soil acidification was estimated for Chinese croplands from 1980 to 2020 and forecasts were 
made up to 2100. The SIC stocks in croplands in 1980 were 2.16 Pg C (16.3 Mg C/ha) 
in the upper 40 cm, 7% (0.15 Pg C; 1.1 Mg C/ha) of which were lost from 1980 to 2020. 
During these 40 years, 7 million ha of cropland has become carbonate free. Another 
37% of the SIC stocks may be lost up to 2100 in China, leaving 30 million ha of crop -

scenario. Compared to the BAU scenario, the reduction in N input by 15%–30% after 
2020 (scenarios S1 and S2) will decrease carbonate dissolution by 18%–41%. If N input remains constant as noted in 2020 (S3) or decreases by 1% annually (S4), a reduction 
of up to 52%–67% in carbonate dissolution is expected compared to the BAU scenario. 
The presence of CaCO

buffering, aggregate formation and stabilization, organic matter stabilization, microbial 
and enzyme activities, nutrient cycling and availability, and water permeability and plant

(SOC) and soil inorganic C (SIC). To mitigate the increasing levels of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere, almost all previous stud -
ies are devoted to SOC because it is associated with and reflects various ecosystem functions, as well as responds quickly to land-use changes and agricultural management practices such as tillage and fertilization (Lal, 2004; Sanderman, 2012; Sheng et al., 2015; Yan et al., 2012). Compared to the short turnover rate of SOC (a few years to centuries), SIC has a considerably longer turnover rate",ts/Global Change Biology - 2020 - Raza - Dramatic loss of inorganic carbon by nitrogen‐induced soil acidification in Chi.pdf,0

"In arid, semiarid and subhumid regions, SIC comprises more C 
than SOC (Lal, 2008). The total stock of SIC at the global level ranges from 695 to 1,738 Pg (1 Pg = 10
15 g) in the upper 100 cm (Batjes, 
1996; Eswaran, Berg, Reich, & Kimble, 1995). The total SIC storage is 50–60 Pg C in China, which is mainly located in arid and semiarid re -
gions in the northwest (approximately 47% of the total land surface; Mi et al., 2008; Wu, Guo, Gao, & Peng, 2009).
SIC stability is largely dependent on soil pH. Soil acidification 
is driven by several processes (Figure 1): (a) nitrification of

lution (Equation  2; Sanderman, 2012). The dissolution of CaCO3 by 
acidification leads to CO2 efflux (Equation  3; Chen, Wang, Luo, & 
Ye, 2013; Zamanian et al., 2018). Therefore, N fertilization changes 
the SIC stocks, increases CO2 efflux to the atmosphere, and subse -
quently affects the global C cycle and global warming (Dalal, Harms, Krull, & Wang, 2005; Drever & Stillings, 1997; Huang et al., 2015). This is the direct effect of N fertilization on CO

and Na+; Lucas et al., 2011). CaCO3 loss decreases the stability of 
soil aggregates and results in poor structure, aeration, and water permeability of the soil (Fernández-Ugalde et al., 2014). Decreases in soil pH because of CaCO
3 loss affect the availability of nutrients, 
microbial activity, and community structure (Rousk et al., 2010). Therefore, the presence of CaCO
3 in the soil is vital for ensuring 
a favorable environment for plant growth and microbial functions. Consequently, N fertilization-induced soil acidification is crucial not only for SIC stocks but also for soil fertility and ecosystem functions.
A recent study at the global scale showed that N fertilization-in -

stantial CO2 amount from the soil (7.48 Tg C/year; Zamanian et al.,

"By comparing the differences in SIC stocks from non-cultivated

(2009) reported that approximately 51% of the cultivated soils had experienced a total SIC loss of 1.6 Pg C due to agricultural land-use activities, including the application of acidifying fertilizers. Since the early 1980s, Chinese agriculture has intensified greatly on a limited land area with large inputs of mineral fertilizers (especially N), which has led to greatly increased crop production.

than the average N input of 75 kg N ha−1 year−1 in developed coun -

high as 500 kg N ha−1 year−1 or greater (Lu et al., 2016). Decreasing 
nitrogen-use efficiency (NUE) by crops means that the majority of the applied N is lost to the environment and adjacent ecosystems, causing negative effects (Guo et al., 2010; Yan et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2015). The atmospheric N deposition has increased con -

Soil acidification driven by nitrification is at least 10–100 times 
greater than acid deposition in China (Guo et al., 2010). Some studies have highlighted the increasing threat of acidification induced by N fertilization over the past decade (Guo et al., 2010; Zhou et al., 2014; Zhu et al., 2020). Soil acidification rate has increased from 2.6 to 7.6 keq H

Major cropland soils were acidified (0.13–0.80 pH units) during the 1980s–2000s mainly due to high amounts of N fertilization (Guo et al., 2010). Grasslands in China have lost SIC at a mean rate of 268 kg C ha
−1 year−1, mainly due to acidification induced by atmo -

cultural use were excluded from the study. In this meta-analysis, we only focused on the SIC stock in the area under crop cultivation in the upper 0–40 cm soil layer because nitrification is particularly fast 
in the topsoil (Ghimire, Machado, & Bista, 2017). N fertilization is relevant only for the Ap horizon and most (>95%) N uptake by roots occurs in the upper 40 cm.SIC stock was calculated using the following equation (Wu et al., 
2009):

(cm), bulk density (g/cm3), inorganic C content (%) mainly as CaCO3, 
and % of rock fragments (>2 mm), respectively; and i  is the soil layer.

which causes soil acidification after it progresses through the ni -

yield and planting area of legumes indicate that the contribution of BNF to total N input (~4%) and associated acidification is minimal in China (He et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2014). Thus, N fertilization and atmospheric N deposition are the major N sources contributing to accelerated soil acidification (Guo et al., 2010; Liu et al., 2013).

During 1980–1996, ammonium bicarbonate (NH4HCO3) and urea 
(CO(NH2)2) were the two major N fertilizer types, comprising >90% 
of the total N fertilizer consumption in China. However, the use of NH

compound fertilizers (Figure 3). The types of N fertilizers that were used during 1980–2016 were obtained from IFASTAT (2020) and the same ratio of these types of N fertilizers was used to calculate the contribution of each fertilizer type to total N consumption in each province.

used as that for N fertilizer.
Finally, based on theoretical assumptions, the potential of H+ re-
lease by each N fertilizer type and atmospheric N deposition was 
calculated as well as their potential to dissolve CaCO3 and release 
CO2 (Table 1).
Based on the information above, two equations were developed

Decreasing NUE and massive increases in N surpluses 
(227  kg N ha−1 year−1) have made China a global N hotspot (Gu, Ju, 
Chang, Ge, & Chang, 2017). N fertilizer use in China increased at an average annual rate of 4% during 1980–2000 and at 2% during 2001–2015 (IFASTAT, 2020). Several studies have highlighted that N fertilization in China is well above crop requirements and there is great potential to decrease N rates without decreasing crop yield (Ju et al., 2009). The Chinese government is devising policies that focus on decreasing N fertilization, such as the Zero Increase Action Plan for Fertilizer Use (MOA, 2015). Based on the current N fertilization rate and the expected decrease in the future, the projected changes in CaCO

during 1980–2000 and at 5 Tg/year during 2001–2020 (Figure 6). 
Under the BAU scenario, CaCO3 dissolution is further expected to 
increase up to 353 Tg (2.6 Mg/ha) until 2050, with a total C loss 
of 800 Tg C (5.9 Mg/ha) by 2100. CaCO3 dissolution decreased the SIC stock. Since 1980 to date (2020), 7% of SIC stock in the upper 
0–40  cm soil layer of croplands has been lost owing to nitrification-
induced acidification. If the N input continues to increase in the same manner (BAU), China may lose 16% of its SIC stocks by 2050 and more than 37% by 2100 (Figure 6).FIGURE 4 Spatial distribution of soil

4.1  || Acidification induced CaCO3 losses from 
cropland soils in China
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study quantifying car -
bonate dissolution from Chinese croplands because of N fertilization-induced soil acidification. CaCO
3 loss by acidification was estimated to 
be 145 Tg C (7% of the CaCO3 stock in 1980) during the last four dec -
ades (1980–2020), which corresponds to an annual loss of 3.6 Tg C from 7 million ha of cropland (Figure 6). These losses decrease the SIC stocks, and five provinces (Guangdong, Fujian, Guangxi, Hunan, and Jiangxi) that had low inherited SIC stocks have already lost more than 75% of their SIC stocks from the upper 40  cm soil layer (Figure 7). If N fertilizer",ts/Global Change Biology - 2020 - Raza - Dramatic loss of inorganic carbon by nitrogen‐induced soil acidification in Chi.pdf,9

depletion by 2020–2100 owing to acidification, which includes the com -
plete depletion of SIC from six provinces and another 11 provinces los -
ing greater than 65% of their SIC stocks. Because N fertilization rate is much higher in orchards and vegetable systems than in croplands, soil acidification is much faster, and subsequent SIC depletion is expected to be more intensive compared to croplands (Gu et al., 2017; Yan et al., 2012). Acidification rates and SIC depletion are comparatively lower in grasslands because of very low N fertilization rates (Yang et al., 2012).
Several studies have highlighted significant amounts of SIC losses 
from acidification worldwide (Zamanian & Kuzyakov, 2019; Zamanian et al., 2018). The results of the Rothamsted long-term study showed that N fertilization- and deposition-induced CaCO

creased carbonate content in the topsoil from 5% in 1865 to less than 1% in 1966 (Bolton, 1972). A long-term study in the North China Plain has shown that high fertilizer inputs have decreased the carbonate content in the topsoil from 2.3% to 3.9% in 1981 to a mean of 0.8% in 2009 (Heimann et al., 2015). Another long-term study in southwest China showed that carbonates were consumed after 25 years of am -
monium fertilization, and soil pH decreased from 7.7 in 1990 to 6.0 in 2013–2015 (Zhang, Vries, Thomas, Hao, & Shi, 2017). Soils in the Yangtze River delta had considerable amounts of carbonates in the 1980s but showed no carbonates or low carbonate contents by 2003 (Wang, Li, et al., 2015). Similarly, the annual acid input of 0.5–34 kmol H

"+ ha–1 year–1 resulted in an average CO2 emission of 145  kg ha−1 year−1 
owing to the dissolution of carbonates from various soils and land uses in Australia (Ahmad, Singh, Dalal, & Dijkstra, 2015). All these studies confirm that SIC loss from dissolution of carbonates is ongoing and very rapid. Increasing N fertilization and atmospheric deposition is common in many countries, which makes acidification-induced SIC loss a global concern (Zamanian et al., 2018). Therefore, it is very urgent for soil acidification to be restrained by decreasing N fertilizer input and improving its efficiency.4.2 || Removal of carbonates is a threat to soil 
fertility and crop productivity
Soil pH and SIC content are positively correlated (Figure 5). CaCO3

crop productivity (Table  3). Decalcification decreases SOM stability

"crop productivity (Table  3). Decalcification decreases SOM stability 
by decreasing the binding of organic matter on Ca2+ (Rowley, Grand, 
& Verrecchia, 2018). CaCO3 dissolution drives the loss of base cations 
(Ca2+, Mg2+, and K+) and subsequently decreases soil fertility (Zhang 
et al., 2016). The accelerated loss of base cations decreases the avail -
ability of exchangeable Ca2+, Mg2+, and K+ by 24% (Lucas et al., 2011). 
The 100-year experiments at Rothamsted showed that continuous 
N fertilization strongly decreased the content of exchangeable Ca2+ 
and Mg2+, and plants exhibited nutrient-deficiency symptoms (Bolton, 
1972; Bolton & Slope, 1971). Base cations once removed from the soil move with water and can negatively influence fresh water quality and aquatic life by salinization and alkalinization (Kaushal et al., 2018). A long-term study at the catchment scale found that acidification re -

Soil pH remains stable at approximately 8, when CaCO
3 content 
is higher than 2% but decreases sharply (from 8.0 to 6.0) as CaCO3 
content falls below 1% (Wang, Li, et al., 2015). There is a nonlin -
ear relationship between soil pH and SIC stock (Figure 5). The ac -
id-neutralizing rate of other buffer systems below pH 6.5 is very slow (except base cation exchange), and their neutralizing capacity depends on the composition of clay minerals and soil parent mate -
rial (Figure 2). Soil pH below 6.5 decreases the microbial biomass, activity, and respiration, and increases the fungal-to-bacterial ratio (Rousk et al., 2010; Tian et al., 2019). At a low pH (≤4.0), there is a sig -

The deficiency of certain plant nutrients (Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+, K+) and 
an excess of aluminum seriously affect nutritional balance, which severely decreases root growth, and the yield and quality of crops (Goulding, 2016). Based on the pH–yield relationship, the increasing soil acidification decreased cereal yields by 4% in China from 1980 to 2010, which may decrease up to 24% by 2050 if acidification from N fertilization continues to increase at the same rate as the present (Zhu et al., 2020). Therefore, producing healthy food from rapidly depleting carbonate soils will be a greater challenge in the future.

this C will be released into the atmosphere and contribute to global warming. Therefore, N fertilization-induced SIC dissolution should be incorporated into regional C budgets and models that predict C cycling in terrestrial ecosystems (Yang et al., 2012; Zamanian & Kuzyakov, 2019; Zamanian et al., 2018).

The application of lime should be regularly prac -

Finally, N uptake by crop cultivars could be improved by introducing genes that are responsible for effective N utilization (Yadav et al., 2017).

emissions were estimated based on H+ that was released only from 
N fertilization and N deposition. The contribution of H+ input from 
other acidifying processes mentioned in Figure 1 was not consid -
ered. Considering all acidification processes, the CaCO3 dissolution 
rate should be more rapid than our estimation. High precipitation also facilitates CaCO
3 loss from the topsoil (Yang et al., 2012); how -

Second, SIC losses were estimated only from the upper 
40 cm. Many soils that are free of carbonate in the top 40 cm still 
have substantial CaCO3 s t o c k s  i n  t h e i r  d e e p e r  l a y e r s  ( F i g u r e  7 ) .  
Consequently, at least part of the produced H+ ions will be leached 
below 40 cm and neutralized by CaCO3 consumption with subse -
quent CO2 release. As the majority of the CaCO3 stocks are found 
below 40 cm (Zamanian, Pustovoytov, & Kuzyakov, 2016), their 
complete dissolution and CO2 release could take centuries or even 
millennia to occur.
Third, CaCO3 dissolution was calculated based on H+ input from 
total N input for each province. However, there are some hotspots 
of very intensive agriculture (e.g., orchards and greenhouse vegeta -
bles) within each province, where N fertilizer use is much higher and, therefore, have a much stronger local influence on soil acidification and CaCO",ts/Global Change Biology - 2020 - Raza - Dramatic loss of inorganic carbon by nitrogen‐induced soil acidification in Chi.pdf,11
"bles) within each province, where N fertilizer use is much higher and, therefore, have a much stronger local influence on soil acidification and CaCO
3 dissolution. Long-term manure application increases soil 
resistance to acidification induced by N fertilization over short peri -
ods and hence can reduce subsequent CaCO3 dissolution (Shi et al., 
2019).
Finally, we only focused on CaCO3 dissolution and loss from the 
soil as CO2. A part of the dissolved CaCO3 may later reprecipitate in 
the soil, for example, during drought conditions (Sanderman, 2012). SIC can also increase by trapping CO
2 coming from mineralization of 
organic matter and root respiration in alkaline soils (Guo et al., 2016; Wang, Wang, et al., 2015; Xie et al., 2009; Zhao et al., 2016). CaCO

5 ||  CONCLUSIONS
CaCO3 dissolution from N-induced soil acidification has depleted 
145 Tg C (1.1 Mg/ha) of SIC stocks from Chinese croplands during 
the past four decades (1980–2020). The unaccounted CO2 released 
from this dissolution was estimated to be 0.53 Pg (3.6 Tg C/year). 
From 1980 to 2020, five provinces have lost more than 75% of their SIC stocks. By 2100, six more provinces will lose all their SIC stocks, and 11 provinces will lose more than 65% of their SIC stocks. Increases in the unaccounted CO

"2 relea se  and  Ca2+ loss from SIC 
dissolution are posing significant threats to the future sustainability of Chinese crop production systems. Therefore, monitoring the pH and carbonate content in soils is recommended, especially in areas with low carbonate levels.
Our scenario analysis indicated that CaCO
3 dissolution could 
be decreased compared to the BAU scenario by up to 52%–67% if N input in China remains constant or will decrease by 1% annually. There is a great need to rethink N fertilization policies and strate -
gies. Measures involving decreasing N fertilizer input (S4) and im -
proving NUE must be adopted. Crops should be fertilized according to their demand while considering the residual N availability in the soil. Integrated nutrient management practices involving N input from various sources (i.e., organic and mineral) should be adopted to avoid soil acidification, CaCO
3 losses, and CO2 release.

1. Increased human-  derived nitrogen (N) loading in terrestrial ecosystems has

plants and soil micro-  organisms adopt a series of P-  acquisition strategies to off -

carbon (C) allocation by plants and soil micro-  organisms; however, it remains 
unclear how P-  acquisition strategies affect soil C cycling. Herein, we review the 
literature on the effects of N loading on P limitation and outline a conceptual 
overview of how plant and microbial P-  acquisition strategies may affect soil or -

1 || INTRODUCTION
Nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) are two of the most important 
limiting factors of plant primary production and microbial func -
tions in the majority of terrestrial ecosystems (Du et al.,  2020 ; Elser 
et al., 2007 ; Hou et al., 2020 ). Human activities have substantially 
altered ecosystem N and P dynamics, which have changed the pat -
tern and extent of global nutrient limitations (Vitousek et al., 2010 ). 
Of particular importance is the increase in anthropogenic N loading 
since the Industrial and Green Revolutions (Peñuelas et al., 2013 ; Yu 
et al., 2019 ). Fossil fuel combustion and agricultural fertilization have 
more than doubled natural levels of reactive N inputs to terrestrial 
ecosystems, in the forms of reduced (e.g. ammonium, ammonia), ox -
idized (e.g. nitrate, nitric oxide, nitrous oxide), or, to a lesser extent, 
organic N (Galloway et al., 2008 ; Peñuelas et al., 2020 ). However,",ts/Functional Ecology - 2022 - Luo - Nitrogen loading enhances phosphorus limitation in terrestrial ecosystems with-1.pdf,1
"idized (e.g. nitrate, nitric oxide, nitrous oxide), or, to a lesser extent, 
organic N (Galloway et al., 2008 ; Peñuelas et al., 2020 ). However, 
sources of P in terrestrial ecosystems are mainly from rock and 
mineral weathering, dust transport and atmospheric P deposition 
(Walker & Syers, 1976 ; Zhu et al., 2016 ). In contrast to the large 
amounts of anthropogenic N loading, the input of P is relatively small 
and much less readily available to plants and soil micro-  organisms 
(Hou et al., 2021 ; Peñuelas et al., 2013 ; Vitousek et al., 2010 ; Wang 
et al., 2022 ). These unbalanced N and P inputs have resulted in 
widespread ecosystem-  level P limitation (Ding et al., 2021 ; Hou 
et al., 2020 ; Li et al., 2016 ; Vitousek et al., 2010 ). Indeed, evidence 
of P limitation caused by N loading has been widely reported in a 
variety of terrestrial ecosystems, including tropical forests, grass -
lands, wetlands and tundra (Deng et al., 2017 ; Du et al., 2020 ; Hou",ts/Functional Ecology - 2022 - Luo - Nitrogen loading enhances phosphorus limitation in terrestrial ecosystems with-1.pdf,1
"variety of terrestrial ecosystems, including tropical forests, grass -
lands, wetlands and tundra (Deng et al., 2017 ; Du et al., 2020 ; Hou 
et al., 2021 ; Li et al., 2016 ).
Soil is one of the largest carbon (C) reservoirs in terrestrial eco -
systems, and soil C storage is commonly influenced by soil nutrient 
status (Fleischer et al., 2019 ; Wieder et al., 2015 ). Increasing soil N 
availability may impact soil C storage by altering C uptake (e.g. pho -
tosynthesis), release (e.g. respiration) and sequestration in both 
plants and soils (Vitousek et al., 2010 ). Furthermore, N loading-  
induced P limitation may affect soil C cycling (Ding et al., 2021 ). 
Given that all living organisms seek to maintain a stoichiometric balance, plants and soil micro-  organisms may adopt a series of P-  
acquisition strategies to offset the effects of N loading-  induced 
P limitation (Chen & Moorhead, 2022 ; Lambers et al., 2013 ;",ts/Functional Ecology - 2022 - Luo - Nitrogen loading enhances phosphorus limitation in terrestrial ecosystems with-1.pdf,1

P limitation (Chen & Moorhead, 2022 ; Lambers et al., 2013 ; 
Marklein & Houlton,  2012 ; Tian et al., 2020 ; Wen et al., 2021 ). 
For instance, vascular plants can increase P acquisition by releas -
ing root exudates, forming symbiotic associations with mycorrhi -
zal fungi or modifying root morphological traits (Jian et al., 2016 ; 
Vitousek et al., 2010 ). Cryptogams, such as mosses and lichens, 
are also well known for their ability to regulate the release of 
extracellular phosphatases in response to increasing N loading-  
induced P limitation in ecosystems such as peatlands, bogs and 
the understorey of boreal forests (Arróniz-  Crespo et al., 2008 ; 
Ochoa-  Hueso et al., 2011 ). Plants can also increase the relative 
abundance of P-  mineralizing and P-  solubilizing free-  living micro-  
organisms (mostly bacteria), which can contribute to mobilization",ts/Functional Ecology - 2022 - Luo - Nitrogen loading enhances phosphorus limitation in terrestrial ecosystems with-1.pdf,1
"abundance of P-  mineralizing and P-  solubilizing free-  living micro-  
organisms (mostly bacteria), which can contribute to mobilization 
of P through the release of phosphatases and low-  molecular-  
weight organic acid (Chen, Li, et al., 2018 ; Chen, Luo, et al., 2018 ; 
Marklein & Houlton,  2012). These P-  acquisition strategies may 
directly or indirectly affect C allocation by plants or soil micro-  
organisms because these strategies have C and energy costs (Lugli 
et al., 2020 ; Ryan et al., 2012). However, it is unclear how these 
P- acquisition strategies may affect soil organic carbon (SOC) sta -
bilization and decomposition (Ding et al., 2021 ). Uncertain impacts 
of P-  acquisition strategies (i.e. P limitation adaptation) on soil C 
cycling limit our ability to fully understand ecosystem feedback to 
N loading in the context of coupled C–  N– P interactions (Fleischer 
et al., 2019 ; Goll et al., 2012 ; Peñuelas et al., 2013 ).",ts/Functional Ecology - 2022 - Luo - Nitrogen loading enhances phosphorus limitation in terrestrial ecosystems with-1.pdf,1

In this review, we first summarize how increased N loading may 
induce ecosystem-  level P limitation and potential consequences on 
ecosystem-  level C cycling. We then discuss how plant and microbial 
adaptation to N loading-  induced P limitation may affect soil C cy -
cling. Finally, we identify key research priorities for future study. This 
review will advance our understanding of how N loading-  induced 
P limitation is linked to soil C cycling in terrestrial ecosystems, and 
thus will increase our capability to better model coupled C, N and P 
biogeochemical cycles under global climate change.4. The trade-  offs between different plant P-  acquisition strategies under N loading

"should be among future research priorities due to their cascading impacts on soil 
C storage. Quantifying ecosystem thresholds for P adaption to increased N load -
ing is important because P-  acquisition strategies are effective when N loading is 
below the N threshold. Moreover, understanding the response of P-  acquisition 
strategies at different levels of native soil N availability could provide insight to 
divergent P-  acquisition strategies across sites and ecosystems. Altogether, P- 
acquisition strategies should be explicitly considered in Earth System Models to 
generate more realistic predictions of the effects of N loading on soil C cycling.

under nitrogen loading enhances ecosystem-  level 
phosphorus limitation
Increases in plant biomass production with N loading can increase 
plant and microbial demands on available P as P is needed for 
stoichiometric balance in both plants and microbes, leading to 
ecosystem-  level P requirements ( Figure  1). Previous studies 
demonstrated that N loading greatly increased plant biomass (Li 
et al., 2016 ). For instance, a meta-  analysis of 288 sites across the 
globe showed that N loading increased above-  ground and below- 
ground biomass by 40% and 11%, respectively (Deng et al., 2017 ). 
Similarly, another meta-  analysis found that P-  induced increases 
in plant above-  ground biomass increased with elevated N (Li 
et al., 2016 ). Nevertheless, N loading induced greater plant biomass,",ts/Functional Ecology - 2022 - Luo - Nitrogen loading enhances phosphorus limitation in terrestrial ecosystems with-1.pdf,2
"in plant above-  ground biomass increased with elevated N (Li 
et al., 2016 ). Nevertheless, N loading induced greater plant biomass, 
which leads to greater P demand as P is a non-  substitutable 
structural component of deoxyribonucleic acid, ribonucleic acid, 
adenosine triphosphate, phospholipids and other components 
in plant cells (Jiang et al., 2019 ). In addition, N loading-  induced P 
limitation is indirectly supported by a positive relationship between 
plant biomass and soil phosphatase activities under N addition across 
various terrestrial ecosystems (Chen, Van Groenigen, et al., 2020 ), 
because phosphatase activity is widely considered as a proxy for 
ecosystem-  level P limitation (Marklein & Houlton, 2012). Overall, 
increased plant biomass production could be an important driver 
of ecosystem-  level P limitation in terrestrial ecosystems under N

Nitrogen loading can increase soil acidification by increasing proton 
release from nitrification, nitrate uptake and nitrate leaching (Lu 
et al., 2014 ). A meta-  analysis suggested that N loading significantly 
reduced soil pH by an average unit of 0.26 in global terrestrial eco -
systems (Tian & Niu, 2015 ). Lower soil pH in neutral and acidic soils 
could promote the dissolution of aluminium (Al) hydroxides and/or 
iron (Fe) (oxyhydr)oxides or calcium (Ca) carbonate, increasing ex -
changeable Al3+, Fe3+ and Ca2+ in the soils (Lu et al., 2014 ). These 
cations can accelerate the formation of iron, aluminium and calcium 
bound phosphates, reducing soil phosphate availability for plant 
and microbial uptake (Deforest & Scott, 2010 ). According to the",ts/Functional Ecology - 2022 - Luo - Nitrogen loading enhances phosphorus limitation in terrestrial ecosystems with-1.pdf,2

and microbial uptake (Deforest & Scott, 2010 ). According to the 
‘adsorption-  penetration theory’ (Barrow,  2021 ), there would likely 
be an increased in the adsorption reaction between phosphate ions 
and the surface of iron or aluminium hydroxides or (oxyhydr)oxides 
and clay minerals, reducing phosphate availability. Both mechanisms 
of N loading-  induced soil acidification and associated soil P precipi -

Lu, et al., 2018 ).
In contrast to neutral and acidic soils, N loading on alkaline soils, 
including arid or semi-  arid ecosystems (drylands) may not induce se -
rious soil acidification, because the buffering capacity of alkaline soil

Nitrogen loading could accelerate ecosystem P limitation by

quantities of plant litterfall (Hou et al., 2021 ). In addition, N loading 
increases N concentrations in plants, consequently changing the 
litterfall quality (i.e. increasing litterfall N/P ratios, Fan et al., 2018 ; 
Heuck et al., 2018 ). Overall, N loading produces substrates with high

micro-  organisms tend to maintain biomass element homeostasis

homeostasis is relatively independent of external conditions and 
has a relatively large tolerance to variations in ecological factors 
(Sterner & Elser,  2002 ). As a result, litterfall of high N/P ratios due 
to N loading likely reduces P availability relative to N availability, 
which may reduce net P mineralization rates from decomposition 
that increases ecosystem-  level P limitations (Fleischer et al., 2019 ;

"STRATEGIES AND THEIR CASCADING 
IMPACTS ON SOIL CARBON CYCLING
To adapt to enhanced N loading and associated P limitation, 
plants can shift their physiological, morphological and symbiotic 
mycorrhizal traits to increase P acquisition (Ding et al., 2021 ; Pang 
et al., 2018 ; Wen et al., 2021 ). Considering the central role of plants 
in soil C cycling, we discuss how plant P-  acquisition strategies 
potentially alter SOC stabilization and decomposition.
3.1  ||  Roles of carboxylate exudation in soil 
carbon cycling
A highly efficient P-  acquisition strategy for plants is to release 
carboxylates from roots (Lambers et al., 2013 , 2015 ; Wen 
et al., 2021 ) because P limitation induced by N loading favours the 
allocation of plant resources towards root exudation (Li et al.,  2018 ; 
Zhu et al., 2016 ) and carboxylates (e.g. citrate, malate and malonate) 
are the major components of root exudates, especially in P-  deficient 
soils (Delgado et al., 2014 ; Ding et al., 2021 ).",ts/Functional Ecology - 2022 - Luo - Nitrogen loading enhances phosphorus limitation in terrestrial ecosystems with-1.pdf,3
"Zhu et al., 2016 ) and carboxylates (e.g. citrate, malate and malonate) 
are the major components of root exudates, especially in P-  deficient 
soils (Delgado et al., 2014 ; Ding et al., 2021 ).
Such an N loading-  induced carboxylate exudation may have 
a significant influence on soil C cycling ( Figure  2a). However, the underlying mechanisms differ between acidic and alkaline soils. In 
acidic soils, carboxylates can liberate C from mineral-  organic com -
plexes via destabilization and dissolution under N loading ( Figure  2a; 
Pang et al., 2018 ). Moreover, releasing carboxylates and other low- 
molecular-  weight C compounds into the soil can stimulate the prim -
ing effect under higher N loading (Keiluweit et al., 2015 ; Shahzad 
et al., 2015 ) because carboxylates are easily assimilable organic 
matter that can serve as a co-  metabolite (Kuzyakov & Xu, 2013 ).

"et al., 2015 ) because carboxylates are easily assimilable organic 
matter that can serve as a co-  metabolite (Kuzyakov & Xu, 2013 ). 
Therefore, carboxylate exudation enhanced by N loading has the 
potential to increase SOC decomposition and thus foster the release 
of more CO2 in acidic soils ( Figure  2a). In alkaline dryland soils, in -
organic C dominates the C pool (Lal, 2019 ) so that enhanced car -
boxylate exudation causes dissolution of calcium phosphates (Ding 
et al., 2022 ). The mobilized Ca2+, in turn, could precipitate with 
CO2 and H2O derived from SOC decomposition or root and micro -
bial respiration to form secondary pedogenic carbonates (Zhong 
& Zhou, 2022 ). Although drylands typically have low soil organic 
matter, they comprise the world's largest biome (Cook et al., 2018 ). 
Thus, N loading-  induced carboxylate exudation in alkaline dryland 
soils may promote soil inorganic C sequestration, which could play",ts/Functional Ecology - 2022 - Luo - Nitrogen loading enhances phosphorus limitation in terrestrial ecosystems with-1.pdf,3
"Thus, N loading-  induced carboxylate exudation in alkaline dryland 
soils may promote soil inorganic C sequestration, which could play 
an important role in global C biogeochemical cycles ( Figure  2b).
In the future, more laboratory and field data are required for val -
idating the potential role of carboxylate exudation in soil C dynam -
ics. Both 13C and 14C isotope-  labelled carboxylates could be used 
to explore the role of carboxylates on soil C storage in laboratory 
studies (Ding et al., 2022 ). In field studies, it is difficult to accurately 
determine concentrations of carboxylates in the rhizosphere (Zhou 
et al., 2021 ). However, the manganese (Mn) content in leaves could 
be used as an index of rhizosphere carboxylate concentrations as 
high leaf Mn contents reflect high concentrations of carboxylates in 
the soil (Lambers et al., 2015 ).

morphological traits on soil carbon cycling
Nitrogen additions have been reported to decrease root biomass 
and specific root length and root surface area (Chen, Tu, et al., 2017 ; 
Wang et al., 2013 ). One explanation might be that increased soil N 
availability will induce plants to allocate a lower proportion of bio -
mass into below-  ground organs based on costs versus benefits, 
in agreement with the optimal allocation hypothesis (Chen, Tu, 
et al., 2017 ; Mei et al., 2010 ). However, N loading-  induced P limita -
tion will cause plants to alter root morphological traits in response 
to low P supply (Jiang et al., 2019 ; Lynch & Brown, 2008 ), such as

phological traits.
Changes in root morphological traits associated with N 
loading-  induced P limitation can affect SOC stabilization (Poirier 
et al., 2018 ). A high fine root density, extensive fibrous roots and a 
high root branching index under P limitation induced by N loading 
can increase soil microaggregates by entangling and enmeshing soil 
particles (Gould et al., 2016 ; Poirier et al., 2018 ), with the occlusion 
of soil organic matter within soil aggregates recognized as a major 
mechanism stabilizing SOC (Lützow et al.,  2006 ). In contrast to SOC 
stabilization, the potential role of changes in root morphological 
traits associated with N loading-  induced P limitation in SOC decom -

that changes in root morphological traits, such as increases in root 
length and diameter, were poorly related to rhizosphere SOC de -
composition. These inconsistencies may result from not separating 
morphological traits from root exudates (Ding et al., 2021 ), which 
future studies may have to elucidate the effects of changes in root 
morphology on SOC decomposition.3.3  ||  Nitrogen loading-  induced symbiotic fungal

Witzgall et al., 2021 ). At the same time, mycorrhizal fungi can also 
stimulate SOC decomposition by releasing extracellular enzymes 
and hydroxyl radicals to soil (Cheng et al., 2012). Moreover, my -
corrhizal fungi could accelerate the mineralization of initial SOC 
through releasing carbon subsidies (mycorrhizal exudates and nec -

reducing the saprotrophic activity of decomposers under N loading 
(Zhou et al., 2020 ), which is referred to as the Gadgil effect (Gadgil

that under N loading soil micro-  organisms can allocate excess N 
to produce phosphatases, thus reducing P limitation (Allison & 
Vitousek,  2005 ). Alternatively, an increased availability of readily 
accessible N may shift microbial priorities to increase acquisition 
of P, as predicted by stochiometric theory (Sinsabaugh & Follstad FIGURE 3 Conceptual diagram depicting how plants alter root morphological traits in response to nitrogen loading-  induced phosphorus",ts/Functional Ecology - 2022 - Luo - Nitrogen loading enhances phosphorus limitation in terrestrial ecosystems with-1.pdf,5

currently few field data to support this hypothesis. Future stud -
ies should compare the C- degrading ability of P-  solubilizing and 
non-  P- solubilizing bacteria to more clearly quantify the role of P-  
solubilizing bacteria in soil C decomposition.
4.3  ||  Microbial carbon use efficiency and its role in 
soil carbon sequestration
Under N loading-  induced P limitation, soil micro-  organisms invest 
energy into the production of enzymes and low-  molecular-  weight 
organic acids (Domeignoz- Horta et al.,  2020 ). Therefore, microbial 
carbon use efficiency (CUE), defined as the fraction of C consumed 
by micro-  organisms that is used for biomass growth (Allison 
et al., 2010 ), would decrease with an increase in other investments 
(Figure  5). The decline in microbial CUE under N loading is consistent 
with observations that N addition decreases the fungi/bacteria",ts/Functional Ecology - 2022 - Luo - Nitrogen loading enhances phosphorus limitation in terrestrial ecosystems with-1.pdf,7
"(Figure  5). The decline in microbial CUE under N loading is consistent 
with observations that N addition decreases the fungi/bacteria 
ratios in P-  deficient soils (Chen, Li, et al., 2018 ; Högberg et al., 2007 ) 
because bacteria- dominated microbial communities often have a 
lower CUE (Högberg et al., 2007 ). Lower microbial CUE can reduce 
necromass, which contributes up to ~80% of SOC (Fan et al., 2020 ; Luo et al., 2020 ). Therefore, N loading-  induced P limitation may 
decrease SOC sequestration by reducing microbial CUE.

AND IMPLICATIONS
5.1  ||  Trade-  offs between plant phosphorus- 
acquisition strategies and soil carbon cycling
Plants may adopt multiple P-  acquisition strategies under N loading, 
and each strategy imposes C costs on the plants (Jiang et al., 2019 ; 
Lambers et al., 2015 ). Indeed, mycorrhizal fungi and carboxylate 
exudation could cost 25%–  50% of below-  ground C allocation (Lugli",ts/Functional Ecology - 2022 - Luo - Nitrogen loading enhances phosphorus limitation in terrestrial ecosystems with-1.pdf,7
"Lambers et al., 2015 ). Indeed, mycorrhizal fungi and carboxylate 
exudation could cost 25%–  50% of below-  ground C allocation (Lugli 
et al., 2020 ). Therefore, plants will likely show trade-  offs between 
strategies used to alleviate P limitation induced by N loading (Ding 
et al., 2021 ; Lynch & Brown, 2008 ). For instance, a study across 14 
coexisting subtropical tree species found that species with lower 
colonization by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi had higher root branch -
ing, whereas species with higher colonization by arbuscular mycor -
rhizal fungi had consistently lower root branching (Liu et al., 2015 ). 
Another study on 10 Kennedia  species reported that carboxylate FIGURE 5 Conceptual diagram of microbial phosphorus-  acquisition strategies and their impacts on soil carbon (C) cycling under nitrogen

Phosphorus-  mineralizing bacteria will increase production of phosphatase enzymes to access organic P while simultaneously producing C- 
acquiring enzymes, stimulating soil organic carbon (SOC) decomposition. Phosphorus-  solubilizing bacteria will release low-  molecular-  weight 
organic acids to mobilize P that also may liberate C from mineral-  organic complexes via destabilization and dissolution. Microbial carbon 
use efficiency (CUE) will decrease under N loading because of C and energy being allocated to the synthesis of enzymes and low-  molecular- 
weight organic acids instead of biomass. A decline in microbial CUE is consistent with reduced production of microbial necromass, leading to 
a reduction in SOC sequestration and increase in SOC loss.",ts/Functional Ecology - 2022 - Luo - Nitrogen loading enhances phosphorus limitation in terrestrial ecosystems with-1.pdf,7

exudation decreased if plants were inoculated with arbuscular myc -
orrhizal fungi (Ryan et al., 2012). Given these findings, an interesting 
and open question is how do plants coordinate diverse P-  acquisition 
strategies to respond to N loading? Because P- acquisition strategies 
can have different impacts on soil C cycling, trade-  offs between 
plant strategies may alter the magnitude or even the direction of the 
response in soil C storage to N loading. In fact, plant P-  acquisition 
strategies probably interactively respond to their effects on soil C 
cycling. In future studies, trade-  offs between plant P-  acquisition 
strategies under N loading should be investigated to better under -
stand relationships between soil C, N and P dynamics.

"5.2  ||  Ecosystem threshold for 
phosphorus adaptation
Although plants and soil micro-  organisms can adopt a series of 
strategies in response to low-  P conditions, these strategies may be 
quantitatively insufficient to deliver enough P to maintain the current 
system state under prolonged N loading (Chen, Xiao, et al., 2020 ). That 
is because cumulative N input has the potential to cause N saturation 
and induce deleterious effects on plant and microbial growth over 
long-  term N loading (Chen, Van Groenigen, et al., 2020 ). Thus, there 
may be an ecosystem threshold for P adaption (Jiang et al., 2019 ), 
below which plants and soil micro-  organisms can maximize short-  term 
P uptake in response to P demand ( Figure  6). Beyond this threshold, 
plants and soil micro-  organisms may generally reduce C allocation for 
P- acquisition, such as decreasing enzyme production, root exudation",ts/Functional Ecology - 2022 - Luo - Nitrogen loading enhances phosphorus limitation in terrestrial ecosystems with-1.pdf,8
"plants and soil micro-  organisms may generally reduce C allocation for 
P- acquisition, such as decreasing enzyme production, root exudation 
or fine root biomass (Carrara et al., 2018 ). In this situation, plant and microbial P acquisition will not meet P demand beyond the ecosystem 
threshold, and ecosystem-  level P limitations will increase ( Figure  6). 
The dominant plant species may subsequently decrease in biomass, die 
and/or be replaced by other plant species, which will likely cause other 
ecosystem-  level changes ( Figure  6). The new ecosystem's P demand 
will probably decrease along with having an increased N threshold. 
Thus, the new ecosystem may be better adapted for increased N 
loading ( Figure  6). Overall, one of the most important challenges in 
understanding the effect of N loading-  induced P limitation on soil C 
cycling focuses on quantifying an ecosystem threshold of P adaption

5.3  ||  Native soil nitrogen availability regulates 
nitrogen loading effects on phosphorus-  
acquisition strategies
Nitrogen loading induces plants to deploy P-  acquisition strategies 
to cope with P deficiency. However, the role of N loading on P-  
acquisition strategies also depends on background levels of soil 
N availability (Chen, Xiao, et al.,  2020 ; Ochoa-  Hueso et al.,  2011 ). 
For instance, in an alpine forest, mycelial biomass and produc -
tion increased under N addition with relatively low native soil N 
availability but decreased when native soil N was relatively high 
(Guo et al., 2021 ). This is consistent with the idea that when N 
loading exceeds an ecosystem threshold, N saturation will inhibit",ts/Functional Ecology - 2022 - Luo - Nitrogen loading enhances phosphorus limitation in terrestrial ecosystems with-1.pdf,8
"(Guo et al., 2021 ). This is consistent with the idea that when N 
loading exceeds an ecosystem threshold, N saturation will inhibit 
plant and microbial P-  acquisition strategies (Jiang et al., 2019 ). 
However, the effect of N loading on phosphatase activity was 
FIGURE 6 Ecosystem threshold for phosphorous (P) adaption under nitrogen (N) loading. When N loading increases, the demand 
for P (black solid line) will increase. Below the ecosystem threshold (red dotted line), plants and soil micro-  organisms can stimulate P- 
acquisition strategies (green dotted line) to meet the demand for P (black solid line). Beyond the ecosystem threshold, N saturation occurs 
and will reduce the energy allocated to P-  acquisition strategies and increase ecosystem-  level P limitation (grey area). When P limitations 
exceed acquisition capacities, the dominant plant species will decrease their plant biomass, die and/or be replaced by other plant species.",ts/Functional Ecology - 2022 - Luo - Nitrogen loading enhances phosphorus limitation in terrestrial ecosystems with-1.pdf,8
"exceed acquisition capacities, the dominant plant species will decrease their plant biomass, die and/or be replaced by other plant species. 
Regardless, the new ecosystem P demand will likely decrease while the ecosystem N threshold increases. In this way, the ecosystem can 
progressively adapt to increased N loading.

with high soil N content (Chen, Xiao, et al., 2020 ). This may be be -
cause plant growth was limited in low-  N soils even with increased 
N loading (Fatemi et al., 2016 ; Jones et al., 2013 ). Under this condi -
tion, N loading will primarily support plant and microbial growth 
rather than phosphatase production that imposes high N costs (Pii 
et al., 2015 ). Nonetheless, these studies demonstrate that native 
soil N availability affects the response of P-  acquisition strate -
gies to N addition. Quantifying the response of these strategies 
to N loading at different native soil N availabilities is important 
to understand different P-  acquisition strategies across sites and 
ecosystems.

cycling under nitrogen loading
Given the importance of P for plant and microbial growth, the inclu -
sion of P cycling in Earth System Models (ESMs) could significantly

increases uncertainties in predicting the effect of ecosystem-  level P 
limitation on soil C fluxes (Chen, Van Groenigen, et al., 2020 ; Jiang 
et al., 2019 ). For instance, some models suggest that future P limita -
tion of plant growth will turn ecosystems into net CO2 sources by the 
end of the 21st century (Wieder et al., 2015 ). However, when plant 
P- acquisition strategies are considered, ecosystems could persist as 
net CO2 sinks with long-  term N deposition (Fleischer et al., 2019 ). 
Consequently, more realistic ecosystem-  level P limitations should be 
included in modelling soil C cycling to accurately estimate C stocks 
and fluxes under N loading.

6 || SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION
Plants and soil micro-  organisms develop a range of P-  acquisition 
strategies under N loading-  induced P limitation, and these 
strategies can directly and indirectly affect soil C cycling. The 
release of carboxylate exudates and phosphatase by plants can 
play an important role in SOC decomposition, whereas symbiotic 
associations with mycorrhizal fungi and modifications of root morphological traits can have impacts on SOC stabilization. 
Increasing the relative abundance of P-  mineralizing bacteria may 
enhance the production of C-  acquiring enzymes with significant 
effects on soil C decomposition, because P-  solubilizing bacteria 
produce low-  molecular-  weight organic acids, which can mobilize 
mineral-  associated C in soils. As more resource is allocated

"produce low-  molecular-  weight organic acids, which can mobilize 
mineral-  associated C in soils. As more resource is allocated 
into microbial enzyme and low-  molecular-  weight organic acid 
production, microbial CUE will decrease, which, in turn, can 
reduce SOC sequestration.
Future research is required to explore the relationships between 
plant and microbial P-  acquisition strategies and soil C cycling, such as 
clarifying trade-  offs between strategies, determining the ecosystem 
threshold of P adaptation and understanding how soil N availability 
regulates the development of P-  acquisition strategies. We envision 
that including different P-  acquisition strategies can significantly im -

Developing technologies to reduce the rate of increase of atmospheric concentration of carbon
dioxide (CO 2) from annual emissions of 8.6 Pg C yr–1from energy, process industry, land-use
conversion and soil cultivation is an important issue of the twenty-ﬁrst century. Of the three optionsof reducing the global energy use, developing low or no-carbon fuel and sequestering emissions, thismanuscript describes processes for carbon (CO
2) sequestration and discusses abiotic and biotic
technologies. Carbon sequestration implies transfer of atmospheric CO 2into other long-lived global
pools including oceanic, pedologic, biotic and geological strata to reduce the net rate of increase inatmospheric CO

"2. Engineering techniques of CO 2injection in deep ocean, geological strata, old coal
mines and oil wells, and saline aquifers along with mineral carbonation of CO 2constitute abiotic
techniques. These techniques have a large potential of thousands of Pg, are expensive, have leakage
risks and may be available for routine use by 2025 and beyond. In comparison, biotic techniques arenatural and cost-effective processes, have numerous ancillary beneﬁts, are immediately applicablebut have ﬁnite sink capacity. Biotic and abiotic C sequestration options have speciﬁc nitches, arecomplementary, and have potential to mitigate the climate change risks.

1. INTRODUCTIONGlobal surface temperatures have increased by 0.8 8C
since the late nineteenth century, and 11 out of the
12 warmest years on record have occurred since 1995(IPCC 2007 ). Earth’s mean temperature is projected
to increase by 1.5–5.8 8C during the twenty-ﬁrst
century ( IPCC 2001 ) .T h er a t eo fi n c r e a s ei ng l o b a l
temperature has been 0.15 8C per decade since 1975.
In addition to the sea-level rise of 15–23 cm during
the twentieth century ( IPCC 2007 ), there have been
notable shifts in ecosystems ( Greene & Pershing
2007 ) and frequency and intensity of occurrence of
wild ﬁres ( Running 2006 ;Westerling et al. 2006 ).
These and other observed climate changes are
reportedly caused by emission of greenhouse gases

"(GHGs) through anthropogenic activities including
land-use change, deforestation, biomass burning,
draining of wetlands, soil cultivation and fossil fuel
combustion. Consequently, the concentration ofatmospheric GHGs and their radiative forcing have
progressively increased with increase in human
population, but especially so since the onset of
industrial revolution around 1850. The concen-
tration of carbon dioxide (CO
2) has increased by
31% from 280 ppmv in 1850 to 380 ppmv in 2005,
and is presently increasing at 1.7 ppmv yrK1or
0.46% yrK1(WMO 2006 ;IPCC 2007 ). Concen-
trations of methane (CH 4) and nitrous oxide (N 2O)
have also increased steadily over the same period
(IPCC 2001 ,2007 ;Prather et al. 2001 ;WMO 2006 ).
Total radiative forcing, externally imposed pertur-
bation in the radiative energy budget of the Earth’sclimate system ( Ramaswamy et al. 2001 ), of all
GHGs since 1850 is estimated at 2.43 W mK2(IPCC

"GHGs since 1850 is estimated at 2.43 W mK2(IPCC
2001 ,2007 ).
There is a strong interest in stabilizing the atmos-
pheric abundance of CO 2and other GHGs to mitigate
the risks of global warming ( Kerr 2007 ;Kintisch 2007 b;
Kluger 2007 ;Walsh 2007 ). There are three strategies of
lowering CO 2emissions to mitigate climate change
(Schrag 2007 ): (i) reducing the global energy use,
(ii) developing low or no-carbon fuel, and (iii)
sequestering CO 2from point sources or atmosphere
through natural and engineering techniques. Between1850 and 1998, anthropogenic emissions are estimatedat 270G30 Pg by fossil fuel combustion and at
136G30 Pg by land-use change, deforestation and soil
cultivation ( IPCC 2001 ). Presently, approximately

unidentiﬁed terrestrial sink probably in the NorthernHemisphere ( Tans et al. 1990 ;Fanet al. 1998 ).
The objective of this paper is to discuss the process
and technological options of CO
2–C sequestration in
one of the long-lived global C pools so as to reduce thenet rate of increase of atmospheric concentration ofCO

each account for approximately 40% of global CO 2

The terrestrial and atmospheric C pools are strongly
interacting with one another ( ﬁgure 2 ). The annual rate
of photosynthesis is 120 Pg C, most of which is
returned back to the atmosphere through plant and
soil respiration. The terrestrial C pool is depleted byconversion from natural to managed ecosystems,extractive farming practices based on low external
input and soil degrading land use. The pedologic pool
loses 0.4–0.8 Pg C yr
K1to the ocean through erosion-
induced transportation to aquatic ecosystems. Theterrestrial sink is presently increasing at a net rate of
1.4G0.7 Pg C yr

approximately 2–4 Pg C yrK1and its capacity may

3. CARBON SEQUESTRATION
Emission rates from fossil fuel combustion increased
by 40% between 1980 and 2000 ( Wofsy 2001 ). Yet,
the amount of CO 2accumulating in the atmosphere
remained the same over this period because the excessCO
2released is being removed by oceans, forests, soils
and other ecosystems ( Battle et al. 2000 ). Atmospheric
CO 2increased at a rate of 2.8–3.0 Pg C yrK1during
the 1980s and 1995, and between 3.0 and3.5 Pg C yr

Therefore, in this context, C sequestration maybe a natural or an anthropogenically driven process.The objective of an anthropogenically driven Csequestration process is to balance the global C budgetsuch that future economic growth is based on a ‘C-neutral’ strategy of no net gain in atmospheric C pool.Such a strategy would necessitate sequestering almostall anthropogenically generated CO

several technologies is important for formulating
energy policies for future economic growth and
development at national and global scales. Theseoptions can be grouped into two broad categories:
abiotic and biotic sequestration.
(a)Abiotic sequestration
Abiotic sequestration is based on physical and chemicalreactions and engineering techniques without inter-vention of living organisms (e.g. plants, microbes). The
abiotic strategy of C sequestration in oceanic and
geological structures has received considerable atten-tion ( Freund & Ormerod 1997 ) because theoretically
abiotic sequestration has a larger sink capacity thanbiotic sequestration. Rapid progress is being made indeveloping/testing technologies for CO

(i)Oceanic injection
Injection of a pure CO 2stream deep in the ocean is a
possibility that has been widely considered by engineersfor about three decades. Following the initial proposalin the late 1970s, there has been considerable progressin oceanic injection of CO
2. To be stable and minimize
outgassing, CO 2must be injected at great depths.
Therefore, liqueﬁed CO 2separated from industrial
sources can be injected into the ocean by one of thefollowing four techniques: (i) it is injected below1000 m from a manifold lying at the ocean ﬂoor, and
being lighter than water, it rises to approximately
1000 m depth forming a droplet plume; (ii) it isalso injected as a denser CO
2–seawater mixture at
500–1000 m depth, and the mixture sinks into thedeeper ocean; (iii) it is discharged from a large pipetowed behind a ship; and (iv) it is pumped into adepression at the bottom of the ocean ﬂoor forming aCO",ts/carbon sequestration.pdf,3

et al. 1997 ,2002 ). However, CO 2injection may also
have some adverse effects on deep sea biota ( Auerbach
et al. 1997 ;Caulﬁeld et al. 1997 ;Seibel & Walsh 2001 ).
In addition to the economics, the issue of stability of
such an injection must be addressed owing to theincreased stratiﬁcation of the ocean water column andits turn over through natural processes.
(ii)Geological injection
This involves capture, liquefaction, transport andinjection of industrial CO
2into deep geological strata.
The CO 2may be injected in coal seams, old oil wells (to
increase yield), stable rock strata or saline aquifers(Tsang et al. 2002 ;Klara et al. 2003 ;Baines & Worden
2004 ;Gale 2004 ). Saline aquifers are underground
strata of very porous sediments ﬁlled with brackish(saline) water. In general, saline aquifers are locatedbelow the freshwater reservoirs with an impermeablelayer in between. Industrial CO

"2can be pumped into
the aquifer, where it is sequestered hydrodynamicallyand by reacting with other dissolved salts to formcarbonates. Carbon dioxide is injected in a supercritical
state that has much lower density and viscosity than the
liquid brine that it displaces. In situ , it forms a gas-like
phase and also dissolves in the aqueous phase, creatinga multiphase multicomponent environment. InjectingCO
2into reservoirs in which it displaces oil or gas could
be an economic strategy of enhanced oil recovery(EOR). Production from oil and gas ﬁelds, which hasbeen in decline, is raised by CO
2-enhanced recovery
(Klusman 2003 ). This strategy of CO 2sequestration is
used in Texas, USA, to inject 20 million Mg ofCO

2003 ). The technique is also used in offshore oil wells

Injected CO 2is absorbed onto coal twice as much as
CH 4, and the process enhances the gas recovery of coal

However, to date, a few direct injection of CO 2have
been made on a commercial scale although theRegional Carbon Sequestration Partnership project ofUS DOE is planning for several demonstrations during2008–2009. Similar to oceanic injection, cost andleakage are principal issues of geological sequestrationwhich need to be resolved. Owing to the low densityand viscosity and injection under supercritical con-ditions, the risks of CO
2leakage through conﬁning
strata may be higher than currently injected liquid
wastes ( Tsang et al. 2002 ). In addition, the chemical
interactions of CO 2with the geological formations may
have to be considered in formulating guidelines forappropriate regulatory and monitoring controls.

"(iii)Scrubbing and mineral carbonation
Mineral carbonation is achieved through mimicry ofnatural inorganic chemical transformation of CO
2(Fan & Park 2004 ). It involves transformation of
industrial strength CO 2emissions into CaCO 3,
MgCO 3and other minerals in the form of geologically
and thermodynamically stable mineral carbonates. It is
a two-stage process: scrubbing and mineral carbona-
tion. Scrubbing, the process of chemical absorption ofCO
2using an amine or carbonate solvent, is the most
widely used method of carbon capture. The CO 2is
puriﬁed by passing through an absorption columncontaining amine solvent. Other solvents used areK
2CO 3, lithium silicate, ceramic and nickel-based
compounds. Pure CO 2gas, recovered by heating the

process uses a slurry of ﬁne particle-sized mineral inwater, at solid concentrations of 15–30%. Dissolutionof the mineral and subsequent carbonation occur in asingle operation as per the following theorized reactions(O’Connor et al. 2000 ;Gerdemann et al. 2004 ):

Geological studies have shown that reserves of

provide raw materials for mineral carbonation ofindustrial emissions for long time ( Goff et al. 1997 ,

occur at slow rate. The challenge lies in increasing therate of reaction by decreasing the particle size,increasing temperature and pressure and using catalyticagents ( Fan & Park 2004 ). Increasing the rate of
reactions, however, requires energy and is expensive.

"(i)Oceanic sequestration
There are several biological processes leading to Csequestration in the ocean through photosynthesis.Phytoplankton photosynthesis is one such mechanism(Rivkin & Legendre 2001 ), which ﬁxes approximately
45 Pg C yr
K1(Falkowski et al. 2000 ). Some of the
particulate organic material formed by phytoplanktonis deposited at the ocean ﬂoor and is thus sequestered(Raven & Falkowski 1999 ). Availability of Fe is one of
the limiting factors on phytoplankton growth in oceanicecosystems. Thus, several studies have assessed theimportance of Fe fertilization on biotic CO
2sequestra-
tion in the ocean ( Martin & Fitzwater 1988 ;Falkowski
1997 ;Martin et al. 2002 ;Boyd et al. 2004 ). It is also
argued that incremental C could be sold as credits inthe developing global C marketplace. Similar to deep
injection, ocean fertilization may also change the
ecology of the ocean ( Chisholm et al. 2001 ). However,",ts/carbon sequestration.pdf,5
"injection, ocean fertilization may also change the
ecology of the ocean ( Chisholm et al. 2001 ). However,
with the current state of knowledge, the topic of oceanfertilization remains a debatable issue ( Johnson &
Karl 2002 ).
(ii)T errestrial sequestration
Transfer of atmospheric CO
2into biotic and pedologic
C pools is called terrestrial C sequestration. Of the8.6 Pg C yr
K1emitted into the atmosphere, only
3.5 Pg or 40% of the anthropogenically emitted CO 2
remains in the atmosphere primarily owing to unspe-ciﬁed terrestrial sinks which sequester atmosphericCO
2and play an important role in the global C cycle.
Terrestrial ecosystems constitute a major C sink owingto the photosynthesis and storage of CO
2in live and
dead organic matter. Owing to its numerous ancillarybeneﬁts (e.g. improved soil and water quality, restor-
ation of degraded ecosystems, increased crop yield),

Forest ecosystems store C as lignin and other relatively
resistant polymeric C compounds. Presently, the netrate of C sequestration in forest ecosystems (otherthan those being deforested) is 1.7 G0.5 Pg C yr
K1(Fanet al. 1998 ). The forest C is sequestered not only
in the harvestable timber, but also in woody debris,
wood products and other woody plants encroaching
upon grasslands ( Wofsy 2001 ). The terrestrial NPP is
not saturated at the current CO 2concentration and
may increase with increase in atmospheric CO 2
concentration through the CO 2fertilization effect.

CO 2fertilization effect may peak during the middle of
the twenty-ﬁrst century ( Kohlmaier et al. 1998 ).
However, at increasing CO 2concentration, the NPP
may be limited by the deﬁciency of N, P, H 2O and other
factors. Interaction between cycles of C, N, P and H 2O,
if moderated through judicious management, may
enhance terrestrial C sequestration.
Afforestation is one of the viable options of C
sequestration in terrestrial ecosystems ( IPCC 1999 ;
Fang et al. 2001 ;Lamb et al. 2005 ). The potential of C
sequestration through afforestation is estimated at3T gCy r

sequestration in US forests, considering all com-
ponents, is 0.3–0.7 Pg C yrK1(Pacala et al. 2001 ).
Restoration of degraded tropical forest is anotherimportant option ( Lamb et al. 2005 ). It is estimated
that 350 Mha of tropical forest have been converted to
other land uses, and another 500 Mha of forests havebeen degraded to varying extent ( Lal 2005 a,b,c). Thus,
establishment of productive and monoculture planta-
tions of Pinus, Eucalyptus andAcacia can enhance the
terrestrial C pool in these ecosystems. There is also apotential for improving the management of secondary
or regrowth forests in degraded tropical landscapes.

been drained worldwide for agriculture ( Armentano &
Menges 1986 ) and forestry ( Paavilainen & Paivanen

at the rate of approximately 1–2 cm yrK1primarily due
to oxidation ( Rojstaczer & Deverel 1995 ;Hillman

lead to reversal of the process and make restoredwetlands once again a sink of atmospheric CO

However, there is a long time lag after the restoration
until processes in restored wetlands become similar tothose of natural wetlands.

cultivated soils normally contain 50–75% of
the original SOC pool. The depletion of the SOC
pool is caused by oxidation/mineralization, leachingand erosion.
Strategies for increasing the SOC pool are outlined
inﬁgure 4 . There is a wide range of degraded soils with
a depleted SOC pool. Important among these are those
degraded by erosion, nutrient depletion, acidiﬁcation
and leaching, structural decline and pollution/contami-nation ( ﬁgure 4 ). Restoring degraded soils and

Integrated nutrient management (INM) is also
essential to SOC sequestration. The humiﬁcation
process can be severely constrained by the lack of N,
P, S and other building blocks of soil humus ( Himes
1998 ). The efﬁciency of C sequestration is reduced
when C and N are not adequately balanced ( Paustian
et al. 1997 ). Therefore, the SOC sequestration rate is
enhanced by an increase in the application of biomass

Application of manures and other organic amend-
ments is another important strategy of SOC sequestra-
tion. Several long-term experiments in Europe haveshown that the rate of SOC sequestration is greater
with application of organic manures than with chemical

by long-term use of manure compared to chemical

(Korschens & Muller 1996 ), 100% over 144 years at

of 10 Mg haK1to cropland in Europe would increase

summer fallow is another option for minimizing losses
of the SOC pool ( Delgado et al. 1998 ;Rasmussen et al.

policy issues ( McCarl & Schneider 2001 ). Trading of C
credits may require several permits (at federal, state andlocal levels) and marketing procedures.
(iii)Secondary carbonates
Soil C sequestration may also occur in SIC assecondary carbonates, and leaching of bicarbonatesinto the ground water. Secondary carbonates occur invarious forms as ﬁlms, threads, concretions andpedants. They also occur as laminar caps, caliche andcalcrate ( Gile 1993 ). In skeletal soils with high gravel
concentration, secondary carbonates occur as coatingson lower surfaces of stones and pebbles. There are four",ts/carbon sequestration.pdf,8
"concentration, secondary carbonates occur as coatingson lower surfaces of stones and pebbles. There are four
principal mechanisms of formation of secondary
carbonates ( Monger 2002 ;Mermut & Landi 2006 ).
Marion et al. (1985) proposed that secondary carbon-
ates are formed through dissolution of CO
2in the
surface layer followed by translocation and re-precipi-tation with Ca
C2and MgC2in the subsoil. In contrast,
Sobecki & Wilding (1983) described the second
mechanism based on capillary rise of CaC2from
shallow ground water and its re-precipitation in thesurface layer. The third mechanism of in situ
dissolution and re-precipitation was proposed by
Rabenhorst & Wilding (1986) .Monger (2002)
observed that pedogenic/secondary carbonates are ofbiogenic origin and are formed by activity of soil fauna(e.g. termites). Chemical reactions describing thedissolution of CO
2are shown in the following

In contrast to SOC, the rate of formation of

4. BIOFUELS
Converting biomass-derived sugars to ethanol andplant-derived oils and fats into bio-diesel is a viablestrategy to reduce use of fossil fuels and developalternate/sustainable sources of energy ( Himmel et al.",ts/carbon sequestration.pdf,8
"2007 ;Stephanopoulos 2007 ;Wald 2007 ). Of the
world’s total primary energy supply of 11.2 Pg of oilequivalent in 2004, 35.03% came from oil, 24.6% from
coal, 20.44% from gas, 6.33% from nuclear and
13.61% from renewable sources ( Goldemberg 2007 ).
Of the renewable sources, 2.48% was contributed bythe traditional biofuels (e.g. animal dung, cropresidues, wood products), and 1.91% by modernbiofuels. Only 3.22% of the primary energy wascontributed by hydro, solar, wind and geothermalsources.
Biofuels, high on the political and scientiﬁc
agenda, are related to C sequestration in twodistinct but interrelated aspects ( ﬁgure 5 ): (i) soilCarbon sequestration R. Lal 823
Phil. Trans. R. Soc. B (2008)",ts/carbon sequestration.pdf,8
"C sequestration through restoration of the depleted
SOC pool, especially when agriculturally degraded/marginal soils are converted to energy plantations,and (ii) recycling of atmospheric CO
2into biomass-
based biofuels. With choice of the appropriatespecies and prudent management, biofuels producedfrom energy plantations established by dedicatedcrops (e.g. poplar, willow, switch grass, miscanthus,karnal grass, Andropogan ,Pennisetum ) can sequester
C in soil, offset fossil fuel emissions and reduce therate of abundance of atmospheric CO
2and other
GHGs. In contrast to the beneﬁcial impacts, somehave argued that there will be in increase incompetition for land and water to establish energyplantations.
With the long-term goal of producing 1 Pg of
lignocellulosic biomass in the USA and 4–5 Pg in theWorld, crop residues (e.g. corn, wheat, sorghum,millet, barley) are increasingly being considered assource of the biomass ( Somerville 2006 ;Graham et al.",ts/carbon sequestration.pdf,9
"2007 ). It is also argued that using corn grain-based
ethanol instead of gasoline reduces GHG emissionsonly by 18% ( Service 2007 ). Thus, ethanol produced
from cellulosic biomass rather than grains is apreferred alternative. Furthermore, the price of corngrains has increased to more than $330 Mg
K1in the
USA, which has a snowballing impact on food pricesin Mexico and elsewhere. Some countries (e.g. USA,China, India) are planning to use 300–400 million Mgof crop residue per annum as a source of renewableenergy, which may have severe adverse consequenceson soils and the environment. Indeed, indiscriminateremoval of crop residues can severely jeopardize soilquality ( ﬁgure 6 ). For example, it has been the",ts/carbon sequestration.pdf,9

Crop residues are not a waste. They are precious
commodities and their use as soil amendments isessential for preserving soil quality ( Wilhelm et al.
2004 ). Adverse impacts of residue removal on soil
quality must be objectively and critically reviewed priorto installing large-scale cellulosic ethanol plants. Thus,cellulosic biomass must be produced on speciﬁcally
established energy plantations. It is also possible toprocure biomass from low-input high-density (LIHD)mixtures of native grassland perennials ( Tilman
et al. 2006 ).

on this topic is now being focused on policy optionsfor slowing emissions of GHGs ( Kerr 2007 ;Kintisch
2007 b). Important among these options are: (i)
imposing tax on C emissions called C tax, (ii)providing government subsidies, and (iii) trading Ccredits. The cap and trade system would ensure theachievement of environment goals. While the market",ts/carbon sequestration.pdf,9

Trading C credits can provide a much neededincome stream for the farmer, and an essentialincentive to invest in soil restoration (e.g. erosioncontrol, irrigation, fertilizers), break the agrarianstagnation and advance food security.

"Depending upon ecosystem characteristics, there may
be site-speciﬁc ecological niches for biotic and abioticsequestration options. Biotic sequestration options areimmediately available. Use of such options buys us
time, while C-neutral energy production technologies
of alternatives to fossil fuels and techniques of abioticsequestration take effect.
7. CONCLUSIONS
Although natural terrestrial and oceanic sinks are
presently absorbing approximately 60% of the
8.6 Pg C yr
K1emitted, natural sink capacity and rate
are not large enough to assimilate all the projectedanthropogenic CO
2emitted during the twenty-ﬁrst
century or until the C-neutral energy sources takeeffect. The sink capacity of managed ecosystems (e.g.forest, soils and wetlands) can be enhanced throughconversion to a judicious land use and adoption ofRMPs of forestry, agricultural crops and pastures.Purposeful manipulation of biological processes canaccelerate the CO

of regulatory measures and identiﬁcation of policy

of biotic/terrestrial sequestration depends on scientiﬁcunderstanding of these coupled cycles.

"2sequestration options. Appro-

developed, especially with regards to measurement,

While carbon sequestration is an importantstrategy, the signiﬁcance of reducing emissions throughdevelopment of carbon neutral technologies cannot beoveremphasized. The latter may involve efﬁcient energyproduction and usage measures, and ﬁnding alterna-tives to fossil fuel. Biofuels (e.g. bioethanol, bio-diesel,methane gas from biodigester and H

N cycling in soil microbial communities, we conducted a 48-h laboratory incubation
with agricultural soil where we stimulated the uptake of inorganic N by amending
the soil with glucose. We analyzed the metagenome and metatranscriptome of the
microbial communities at four time points that corresponded with changes in N
availability. The relative abundances of genes remained largely unchanged through-
out the incubation. In contrast, glucose addition rapidly increased the transcription
of genes encoding ammonium and nitrate transporters, enzymes responsible for N

"Inorganic nitrogen (N) availability in soil dictates several ecosystem-level processes
such as plant growth (1), greenhouse gas emissions in the form of nitrous oxide (2),
and eutrophication from runoff (3). The transformation of N by soil microbial commun-
ities is directly tied to the pool of bioavailable N in soils (4, 5). Thus, understanding the
controls of N metabolism in soil microbes is key to determining, and potentially man-aging (6), the cycling of N in soils. Although genes and regulatory mechanisms for mi-
crobial N cycling processes have long been identi ﬁed in laboratory studies (7 –9), the
short-term dynamics and controls of N cycling in complex soil communities remainpoorly understood. The availability of shotgun sequencing technologies to analyze mi-
crobial functioning in soil communities provides an opportunity to enhance our under-
standing of microbially mediated soil N cycling.

"standing of microbially mediated soil N cycling.
Measuring short-term responses of soil microbial populations to changes in the
environment is crucial in understanding the role of microbes in biogeochemical cy-cling. Most biogeochemical transformations occur during short periods of intense mi-
crobial activity, when the active fraction of microbes may be up to 20 times higher
than that in bulk soil (10). This stimulation is often the result of a localized increase innutrient concentrations, such as in the rhizosphere or an area of fresh organic matter
decomposition. Despite the importance of these “hot moments, ”only a few studies
(11, 12) have tracked changes in N cycling gene transcription in soils.
Notably, the short-term (hours to days) transcriptional response of N cycling genes

"to labile C inputs has yet to be determined. Microbial communities experience sudden
changes in C and N availability associated with plant root exudation (13), trophic inter-
actions (14, 15), and litter leachate (16). Since soil microbes are typically limited by la-
bile C and energy (17 –19), the addition of a C-rich substrate is expected to stimulate
growth and activity (20), increasing the demand for N (21). Whether N is derived from
the uptake of organic N present in the substrate or mineral N available in the soil
depends largely on the C-to-N (C:N) ratio of the substrate (22). For example, in a studyby Yang et al. (23), soil microbial communities assimilated organic N during the miner-
alization of added glycine, but in the presence of glucose, the mineralization of glycine
was initially suppressed, and ammonium served as the main source of N. Simple sugars
such as glucose have accordingly been shown to in ﬂuence protease activity (24). The",ts/C_amp_N.pdf,1

such as glucose have accordingly been shown to in ﬂuence protease activity (24). The
metabolic pathways for N immobilization have been well characterized in vitro (25). A
majority of N assimilation into biomass occurs through the conversion of NH
41into
the amino acids glutamine and glutamate, which are used as sources of N for all other
amino acids. Under low-to-moderate intracellular concentrations of NH41, the enzymes
glutamine synthetase (GS) (encoded by glnA ) and glutamate synthase (GOGAT) ( gltS)
convert NH41to glutamate in a two-step reaction referred to as the GS-GOGAT path-
way (26). Under high concentrations of NH41, the enzyme glutamate dehydrogenase
(GDH) ( gudB and gdhA ) converts NH41directly to glutamate in a one-step reversible
reaction (27).

reaction (27).
Since both the GS-GOGAT pathway and GDH require N as NH41, other forms of inor-
ganic N must be converted to ammonium before conversion into biomass. In the case
of nitrate and nitrite, the reduction to ammonium occurs through either assimilatorynitrate reduction or, under anoxic conditions, dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammo-
nium (DNRA) (see Table S1 in the supplemental material) (28). The conversion of
atmospheric N
2to ammonium by diazotrophs is catalyzed by the enzyme nitrogenase
(nifDHK ) (29).
The mechanisms regulating N uptake in response to C have been extensively stud-
iedin vitro (8, 25). The complex regulatory network includes a specialized sigma factor

tivity of many of the enzymes and proteins in the phosphorylation cascade is tightly
controlled by cellular concentrations of glutamine and oxoglutarate (31). Since the
concentration of oxoglutarate is impacted by the activity of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA)cycle, the regulation of N cycling is directly tied to C metabolism (32).Chuckran et al.

"Carbon substrate addition is also thought to in ﬂuence dissimilatory N cycling processes
such as nitri ﬁcation and denitri ﬁcation. In nitri ﬁcation, ammonia is oxidized to nitrite and
then nitrate. Often, the steps of this process occur in different organisms (33); however, com-plete ammonia oxidizers have also been described (34, 35). In denitri ﬁcation, nitrate is
reduced to nitrite, nitric oxide, and then nitrous oxide and N

rates of heterotrophic nitri ﬁcation may increase after labile C inputs (38). Denitri ﬁcation is
more directly in ﬂuenced by C availability and quality (39), and the abundance of mRNA tran-
scripts associated with denitri ﬁcation was stimulated with the addition of glucose in anoxic
soil microcosms (40).
Despite our knowledge of the mechanisms and controls of N cycling and N metabo-
lism, we do not yet fully understand how these genes are regulated within complexsoil microbial communities. Metatranscriptomics allows us to capture the transcrip-tional pro ﬁle of a microbial community, providing insight into the potential activity of
a community at a given moment in time (41 –43). Many studies utilizing this technique

"stoichiometric plasticity in response to nutrient inputs (54); however, a decrease in the bio-
mass C:N ratio in response to C inputs is counterintuitive. Since the method of microbial bio-
mass extraction used involves two extractions on the same sample (one before and one af-
ter fumigation), incomplete extraction of the added glucose in the ﬁrst extraction could
result in an arti ﬁcially high estimate of biomass C. We believe that it is far more likely that mi-
crobial biomass and stoichiometry did not change and that changes in the estimated MBC
are likely the result of unextracted glucose remaining from the initial K2SO4extraction.

"changes coincided with a decrease in inorganic N and an increase in the transcript
abundance of genes involved in inorganic N uptake, assimilation, and N metabolism
regulation. These results demonstrate that soil microbial communities respond to la-
bile C not only by upregulating genes associated with C metabolism but also by rapidly
increasing the transcription of genes responsible for N acquisition. Furthermore, we
found that genes for several forms of N acquisition (e.g., N ﬁxation, assimilatory nitrate
reduction, and ammonium transport) were differentially transcribed over the 48-h
incubation, indicating that changes in multiple microbially mediated N transformations
occur within this small temporal window.

the dominant pathway for the assimilation of inorganic N in soil microbial communities
responding to labile C inputs. This ﬁnding is consistent with the notion that GDH is
most active when the NH
41concentration is high and the availability of C is low (27).
Assays of soil microbial communities have also shown that GS activity increases in
response to higher C-to-N ratios, whereas GDH activity decreases (56). Furthermore, we

Various mechanisms for transporting inorganic N across the cell membrane were

ammonium transporter AmtB, was the second most abundant upregulated gene dur-ing the incubation (behind glnA ). Similarly, we observed an upregulation of genes

"nitrate reduction was primarily occurring under aerobic conditions. Notable exceptions
were the genes nirB and nirD, which encode the cytosolic enzyme nitrite reductase
NirBD (59), which has been shown to be active in aerobic soils (60, 61) and may func-
tion as the nitrite reductase in assimilatory nitrate reduction (62). Although the upregu-
lation of N transport genes in response to glucose is certainly not novel (30), theseresults are the ﬁrst demonstration of this response in a soil microbial community meta-
transcriptome. Furthermore, these responses show the short time frames (within 8 h)in which soil microbial communities can respond to changes in C and N availability.

"nase, especially when NH
41concentrations were low, is consistent with the idea that
nitrogen ﬁxation increases when N concentrations are low (63). N ﬁxation has been
shown to be activated by the addition of other limiting nutrients such as carbon or
phosphorus (64, 65). We therefore believe that the upregulation of nitrogenase genes
is a response to low concentrations of NH41and the availability of labile C. The prompt
upregulation, and subsequent downregulation, of nitrogenase genes also suggeststhat some portion of biological nitrogen ﬁxation occurs rapidly in soils or at the very
least that the process is highly sensitive to concentrations of NH
41.

"with NH41and NO32transport maintained their high abundances despite concentra-
tions of NO32stabilizing and concentrations of NH4increasing (24 to 48 h into the
incubation). One possible explanation is that the activity of these proteins is dictatedthrough allosteric regulation, which is tightly connected to the activities of both C and
N metabolism (Fig. 5). For example, the ammonium transporter AmtB is allosterically
inhibited by the PII protein GlnK, which is indirectly controlled by internal concentra-tions of glutamine, an intermediate of N uptake through GS-GOGAT (Fig. 5), and oxo-glutarate, an intermediate of the TCA cycle (Fig. 5) (32, 66). In this way, internal concen-trations of metabolites from both C and N metabolism may dictate N uptake.

metabolites in regulation. We found that the abundances of transcripts for transcrip-tional regulators (such as nac,lrp, and crp) and",ts/C_amp_N.pdf,9

s54were either not affected or slightly
reduced (Fig. 5). In contrast, transcripts for genes in the phosphorylation cascade,
which links C and N metabolism through intermediate metabolites, were more abun-
dant after the addition of glucose (Fig. 5). The upregulation of the two-component reg-ulatory system NtrB ( glnL and ntrB) and NtrC ( glnG and ntrC) within this cascade is
especially noteworthy as this system regulates ;75 genes associated with N acquisi-
tion, including glutamine synthetase (Fig. 5) (67).
Since the activity of this regulatory network is tightly controlled by internal concen-
trations of metabolites (30), it is not possible to determine the activity of many of theseproteins through the metatranscriptome alone. However, it is noteworthy that almostall of the genes within this regulatory network were upregulated, even if the encoded",ts/C_amp_N.pdf,9

upregulation of genes in the phosphorylation cascade may be bene ﬁcial during C
uptake, as it allows the concentration of nutrients and metabolites to control N uptake,thereby ensuring that N uptake matches the supply of C (25, 32).
Nitriﬁcation and denitri ﬁcation. Most genes associated with nitri ﬁcation and deni-
triﬁcation were signi ﬁcantly downregulated. Since nearly all nitri ﬁers in this soil were
autotrophic archaea (68), this ﬁnding is consistent with the premise that the addition
of glucose reduces the rates of autotrophic nitri ﬁcation by reducing the amount of
available ammonium (37). It is not especially surprising that we did not ﬁnd an upregu-
lation of denitri ﬁcation genes, as denitri ﬁcation is most prevalent in anoxic systems

proteins were uncommon and present in low abundances, the chance of obtaining a
false-positive result is much greater, and we are therefore cautious to draw any conclu-sions based on these data alone. Changes in gene abundance for most N cycling genes
were absent. These results suggest that understanding the response of soil microbial
communities to short-term changes in the environment necessitates looking beyond
the metagenome, as consequential microbial responses occur through changes in
gene expression. This is in line with other studies where the composition of transcripts
shifts over hours or days (12, 69), whereas shifts in metagenomic community composi-

likely not demonstrate a response similar to the one observed for this agricultural soil.

extremely useful for controlling environmental variables and isolating a particularresponse. However, it is likely that under ﬁeld conditions, and in the presence of plant
roots, factors other than C availability will affect gene expression at the same time and
to different degrees, potentially masking the response observed in this short-term lab-
oratory experiment.
Conclusions. Our results indicate the strong and rapid upregulation of genes asso-

phic, suggesting that these processes dominate the short-term response to labile C in
these soils. Perhaps most importantly, this work highlights the importance of microbial
gene transcription in controlling short-term biogeochemical cycling in soils. Within the
48-h incubation, we found that microbially mediated transformations of N were well
reﬂected in the metatranscriptome but not in the metagenome or in microbial bio-
mass. The short-term transcriptional responses of soil microbes may therefore serve an
important role in determining how biogeochemical ﬂuxes respond to immediate
changes in the environment.

concentration, concentrations of NO32and NH41, and microbial biomass. A portion of each sample was

effects on yield, soil organic carbon storage, nitrate leaching and/or ammonia volatilization. We identi ﬁed additional
strategies with potential to reduce crop residue N 2O emissions without strong negative side-effects, which require fur-
ther research. These are: a) treatment of crop residues before ﬁeld application, e.g., conversion of residues into biochar
or anaerobic digestate, b) co-application with nitri ﬁcation inhibitors or N-immobilizing materials such as compost
with a high C:N ratio, paper waste or sawdust, and c) use of residues obtained from crop mixtures. Our study providesKeywords:

adequate crop residue management.
1. Introduction
Regulating atmospheric greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations and en-
suring food and nutrition for the growing world population are two of the
greatest challenges facing humanity today. Crop residue application in ag-
ricultural soils has been posited as a tool to simultaneously tackle both chal-
lenges. This is because crop residues contribute to maintaining or even
increasing soil carbon storage in soils while improving soil fertility, thereby
enhancing sustainability of food production ( Watson et al., 2002 ). How-
ever, the potential bene ﬁts of crop residue retention (i.e., the fraction of
biomass left on the ﬁeld and possibly incorporated into the soil following
harvest) for C sequestration and thus, climate change mitigation could be

"harvest) for C sequestration and thus, climate change mitigation could be
partly or fully offset by increased emissions of the powerful greenhouse
gas nitrous oxide (N 2O), as shown in several meta-analyses ( Chen et al.,
2013 ;Shan and Yan, 2013 ;Xia et al., 2018 ;Hu et al., 2019 ;Muhammad
et al., 2019 ). Agricultural soils are the largest anthropogenic source of
N2O emissions, and N 2O emissions due to crop residue retention in agricul-
turalﬁelds account for a substantial fraction of these ( EEA, 2020 ). Global
N2O emissions from crop residues have been estimated to increase steadily
over the last decades mainly due to higher crop production, reaching ap-
proximately 0.224 Gt CO 2-eq in 2017 ( FAO, 2021 ). To harness the bene ﬁts
of crop residue retention, we must identify the conditions and residue man-
agement strategies that minimize N 2O emissions after application or incor-
poration, avoiding trade-offs in terms of soil C sequestration and soil

"agement strategies that minimize N 2O emissions after application or incor-
poration, avoiding trade-offs in terms of soil C sequestration and soil
fertility.
In this study, we combine a literature review and meta-analysis to iden-
tify and assess measures for mitigating N 2O emissions from crop residues.
We evaluate the degree of certainty associated to their mitigation potential,
the most important general conditions under which every measure is ex-
pected to be effective, and positive and negative side-effects. We also pro-
pose future research avenues to address the knowledge gaps precluding
effective implementation of these measures. These knowledge gaps include
the interactions between management, climate and residue composition
that make emissions dif ﬁcult to predict at regional and global scales.
While there are other meta-analyses focused on the effect of crop residues

on other ecosystem services.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Literature review
Mitigation measures for N 2O emissions from crop residues were col-
lated from the literature using ISI Web of Science, SCOPUS and Google
Scholar. The search terms were: “residue ”OR “straw ”OR “stubble ”AND
“nitrous oxide ”OR “N2O ”OR “greenhouse gas ”OR “GHG ”OR “emission
factor ”AND “measure ”OR “strategy ”. After screening the literature, the
measures were categorized according to: residue physical management,

"measures were categorized according to: residue physical management,
residue incorporation timing, interactions with fertilisation, additives and
crop residue modi ﬁcations, crop type, and edaphoclimatic conditions
(Table 1 ). Information from the articles was used to present and discuss
the individual factors (e.g., precipitation, tillage) determining the effective-
ness of each measure. A comprehensive literature review (or purposive re-
view following Cook (2019) ) was used as a basis to assess the positive and
negative side-effects of the mitigation measures in relation to crop yields,
soil organic carbon (SOC), nitrate leaching and ammonia (NH 3) volatiliza-
tion, among others.2.2. Database
To gain a quantitative understanding of the potential of every residue
management measure to mitigate N 2O emissions from crop residues, we

crop residues on N 2O emissions. Crop residues are considered as any above-
ground plant component of a crop returned to the soil. The database
consisted of 367 selected pairwise comparisons reported in 78 studies,
which met predetermined quality criteria (only studies with replication,
with detailed information, and performed under realistic ﬁeld conditions)
(Rittl et al., 2022 ). Pairwise comparisons only included observations
where a treatment (i.e., with crop residue retention) and a control(i.e., with crop residue removal) could be compared with all other factors

The database provides information about the management, site, and ex-
perimental factors from each study, which allowed us to test the effect of
several mitigation measures identi ﬁed through the literature review. To
do so, we extended the database in this study creating additional variables
that categorize the available information into moderators for a meta-
analysis. For example, according to the crop residue application method,
observations were categorized as incorporated (when crop residues were
mechanically incorporated into the soil) or surface applied (when residues
were retained at the soil surface without incorporation, e.g., via mulching).
The speci ﬁc information about crop residue incorporation depth was cate-
gorized into deep ( ≥15 cm) and shallow ( <15 cm). Information about

"fertilisation at the time when the residues were incorporated was coded
as in combination with and without fertiliser application. Moreover, for
studies assessing residue management in combination with fertiliser appli-
cations, we categorized studies according to the type of fertiliser applied
(synthetic, organic, or combination of synthetic and organic). The timing
of residue incorporation was grouped as autumn incorporation versus
spring incorporation.
For the measures that could not be analysed with the database, the
quantitative N
2O mitigation potential was derived from a literature review
based on individual studies for novel measures such as anaerobic digestion
of crop residues or crop residue mixtures, for which the empirical evidence
is more limited ( Table 1 ). Certain management strategies, such as liming in

were not enough observations in the database, and because the available in-
formation did not attribute the effect of the mitigation measure to N 2O
emissions from crop residues (most available strategies are focused on
fertiliser-derived N 2O emissions). Due to limited data availability, the
main edaphoclimatic drivers potentially regulating each mitigation mea-
sure are discussed qualitatively based on the literature review, and not
quantitatively through statistical tools.
2.3. Meta-analysis
The effect of mitigation measures for crop residues on soil N 2O emission
was assessed by calculating the natural logarithmic response ratio (lnR) as
an effect size for each observation ( J. Chen et al., 2020 ;X. Chen et al., 2020 ;

We conducted a weighted mixed-effects model meta-analysis using the
“rma.mv ”function from R package “metafor ”(Viechtbauer, 2010 ). Since
several studies contributed more than one paired observation, we consid-
ered “study ”and “observation ”as random factors in the mixed-effects
models. For ease of interpretation, the overall effect size was converted
into percentage change, i.e., (elnR−1)∗100%. We considered the effect
size to be signi ﬁcant (i.e., it changes N 2O emissions compared to crop resi-
due removal) when the 95% CI of experimental classes did not include zero.To evaluate statistical differences between sub-groups within mitigation
measures, we used a Wald-type test.

3. Results and discussion
In this section, for every mitigation measure we ﬁrst describe the effect
on N
2O emissions from crop residues based on either a meta-analysis or lit-
erature review (methodology based on the data availability), and then we
present the main side-effects on ecosystem services.
3.1. Crop residue removal versus residue in the ﬁeld
On average, crop residue incorporation increases soil N 2O emissions by
40–50% compared to scenarios where residues are removed from the ﬁeld
(Abalos et al., 2022 ). Accordingly, the easiest way to reduce N 2Oe m i s s i o n sfrom aboveground crop residue retention in the ﬁeld would be removing
the crop residues, thus eliminating N and C compounds which would fuel
soil microbial processes. However, crop residue removal cannot be general-
ized as a bene ﬁcial management practice. This is because crop residue in-
corporation into the soil can sometimes decrease N 2Oﬂuxes (more details",ts/A review and meta-analysis of mitigation measures for nitrous oxide.pdf,2
"ized as a bene ﬁcial management practice. This is because crop residue in-
corporation into the soil can sometimes decrease N 2Oﬂuxes (more details
in the following sections), and because crop residues enhance other
agroecosystem services that may outweigh the mitigation bene ﬁts for
N2O of removing crop residues ( Table 1 ). For example, removing crop res-
idues represents a substantial export of nutrients out of the ﬁeld, which has
negative effects on crop yields and SOC stocks in the long-term ( Chowdhury
et al., 2015 ). An increased requirement for N fertilisation will be needed in
the medium to long term to partially compensate for the nutrient exports,
increasing the risk for N 2O emissions. As SOC stocks may decrease, also
the soil anion retention capacity decreases, which has been found to stimu-
late nitrate leaching from fertiliser application ( Xia et al., 2018 ). Removal
of crop residues also decreases the soil water holding capacity, soil struc-",ts/A review and meta-analysis of mitigation measures for nitrous oxide.pdf,2

of crop residues also decreases the soil water holding capacity, soil struc-
tural stability, soil water in ﬁltration as well as increase soil bulk density
and erosion, factors that may in ﬂuence negatively crop productivity and
ecosystem services. Crop residues sustain decomposer food webs in arable
soil; therefore, removing crop residues denies a source of energy for soil bi-
ological activity and growth with potentially negative impacts on nutrientretention and soil biodiversity ( Liu et al., 2016 ;Drost et al., 2020 ). The neg-
ative aspects of removing crop residues from the ﬁeld could be partially
compensated if they are used for e.g., biofuel production and biore ﬁnery,
which would increase farmers´ revenue and decrease farm level GHG
emissions.

"driven by the type of crop residue. This is because crop residues can have
large differences in biochemical characteristics. The most common bio-
chemical property used to predict the effect of crop residues on N 2Oe m i s -
sions is the C:N ratio. Crop residues with a C:N ratio lower than 20 –30
are expected to cause net N mineralization due to their high N concentra-
tion, while those with C:N ratios higher than 30, as is generally the case
in cereal straw, were found to result in net N immobilization ( Alexander,
1977 ;Trinsoutrot et al., 2000 ;Redin et al., 2014 ). A recent meta-analysis
conﬁrms this threshold and indicates that the balance between net N min-
eralization and immobilization explains the differences in N 2O emissions
between crop types according to their C:N ratios ( Abalos et al., 2022 ). Im-
mobilization of soil N may decrease N 2O emissions due to reduced avail-

"mobilization of soil N may decrease N 2O emissions due to reduced avail-
ability of ammonium and nitrate for the processes of nitri ﬁcation and
denitri ﬁcation ( Baggs et al., 2000 ).
Recent studies have shown that the degree of crop maturity at which the
residues are generated can be a simple and robust way to integrate crop res-
idue biochemical characteristics of importance for N 2O emissions, in addi-
tion to the C:N ratio. According to this categorization, incorporation of
residues from immature crops into the soil after crop termination increases
N2O emissions compared to incorporation of residues from mature crops
(Abalos et al., 2022 ;Janz et al., 2022 ;Lashermes et al., 2022 ). Immature

composable C provide an energy source for denitrifying bacteria and for
general microbial activity that deplete soil O
2via enhanced soil respiration
(Li et al., 2016 ;Surey et al., 2020 ), stimulating denitri ﬁcation. Indeed, de-
nitriﬁcation is frequently the main source of short-term N 2O emissions
when organic matter containing highly degradable C is applied to soil
(Köster et al., 2011 ;Li et al., 2016 ;Surey et al., 2020 ). When there is a
high content of easily mineralizable N or even nitrate in immature residues
or the ammonium present in the residue is rapidly nitri ﬁed. The risk for

"residues are mainly represented by green plant biomass (cover crops, vege-
table residues, and grasslands), whereas mature residues are mainly straw

Cover crops provide a wide range of ecosystem services ( Haruna and
Nkongolo, 2015 ), including reductions of N losses in the form of nitrate
leaching ( Abdalla et al., 2019 ), potentially reducing soil N 2O emissions dur-
ing their growing phase due to the depletion of soil inorganic N and the ab-
sence of fertilisation. These effects may be species-speci ﬁc, with legumes
promoting higher emissions than non-legumes due to their lower capac-
ity/need to acquire N from the soil ( Muhammad et al., 2019 ). In grassland,

"sions, especially legume-based herbage. Compared to roots and stubbles,
herbage has a higher degradability due to its biochemical composition
and lack of interaction with soil mineral particles ( Rasse et al., 2005,
2006 ). Residues from vegetable production are particularly prone to caus-
ing high N 2O emissions due to the high input of highly degradable C and
N from their residues, and due to their high requirements for fertilisers, ir-
rigation, and tillage ( Baggs et al., 2000 ;Nett et al., 2015 ;Nett et al., 2016 ;
Qasim et al., 2021 ).
Alternatives to incorporation of immature crop residues may have pos-
itive side-effects. For example, immature crops can be sold as animal feed,
increasing farmer's revenue. Incorporating cover crop residues into the soil
may hinder rapid establishment of the succeeding crop by slow soilwarming when used as mulch ( O'Brien and Daigh, 2019 ), or due to release
of growth inhibiting substances ( Putnam and DeFrank, 1983 ). By removing",ts/A review and meta-analysis of mitigation measures for nitrous oxide.pdf,3
"of growth inhibiting substances ( Putnam and DeFrank, 1983 ). By removing
crop residues, the risk for transferring residue-borne pathogens and plant
diseases from one season to the next, decreases ( Govaerts et al., 2007 ).
Many of these negative aspects can be avoided or reduced if crop residues
are removed from the ﬁeld, or if residues are treated (biochar or digestate,
seeSection 3.6 ) before incorporation. On the other hand, there are numer-
ous reasons to incorporate immature crop residues into the soil. They are
nutrient rich, and therefore incorporation into the soil may increase nutri-
ent supply to the succeeding crop and decrease N fertiliser requirements,which is of particular importance for organic vegetable growers. Cover

The decay rate of crop residues placed on the soil surface is generally
slower than if incorporated into the soil. This is because highly variable
moisture conditions and N limitation at the soil surface hamper residue de-
composition, and this is particularly true for mature residues having moder-
ate to high C:N ratio ( Coppens et al., 2007 ;Chaves et al., 2021 ;Chen et al.,
2014 ). Surface-applied residues may increase the distance between C sub-
strates and soil N, limiting N availability for decomposers and thus lowering
soil N immobilization effects by residues ( Coppens et al., 2007 ). Therefore,",ts/A review and meta-analysis of mitigation measures for nitrous oxide.pdf,3
"strates and soil N, limiting N availability for decomposers and thus lowering
soil N immobilization effects by residues ( Coppens et al., 2007 ). Therefore,
residues may increase mineral N, soluble C and moisture at the soil-mulch
interface, representing a hot spot of denitri ﬁcation ( Kravchenko et al.,
2018 ). Thus, surface application of residues could lead either to lower or
higher N
2O emissions depending on the environmental conditions (rain-
evaporation regime, and residue type, mulch mass and thickness). This is
reﬂected in our meta-analysis, where N 2O emissions from surface-applied
or incorporated residues are not signi ﬁcantly different due to the large var-
iation within each category ( Fig. 1 ).

face crop residue application compared to soil incorporation ( Xia et al.,

hance NH 3volatilization of surface applied fertiliser ( Pinheiro et al.,
2019 ). This, together with slower decomposition of surface-applied plant

Although the effect was not signi ﬁcant, our meta-analysis indicates a
trend for higher N 2O emissions when crop residues were incorporated at
depth ( >15 cm) as compared to a shallower incorporation ( Fig. 2 ;P≤
0.10). This is probably an interactive effect of crop residue placement and
the tillage system required for such placement. Six et al. (2004) argued
that long-term adoption of no-till as compared to reduced tillage
(i.e., shallow incorporation) increases soil organic matter content in the
upper soil layers, and results in improved soil structure. The latter may de-
crease the tendency for the formation of anaerobic microsites conducive to
N2O production ( Malhi et al., 2006 ;Ussiri et al., 2009 ). Additionally, O 2dif-
fusion rates decrease with soil depth, thus crop residue decomposition is

with synthetic N fertilisation, which may trigger N 2O emissions

tumn incorporation are that it may increase nitrate leaching ( Hansen

and losses of phosphorus ( Bechmann and Bøe, 2021 ). In areas prone to
freezing during winter, residue incorporation in the autumn can greatly
increase N 2O emissions compared to incorporation in the spring

tion may increase N 2O emissions ( Taghizadeh-Toosi et al., 2021 ). This is
because increased litter decomposition and reduced O 2diffusion into soils

triﬁcation not only due to anaerobiosis but also by provisioning of labile
C(Butterbach-Bahl et al., 2013 ). However, clear generalizations regarding
this effect are not possible, since the outcome in terms of N 2O emissions is
likely to depend on interactions between soil moisture, residue incorpora-
tion depth, soil properties including soil compaction, as well as residueproperties ( Kravchenko et al., 2018 ). Reviewing pairwise comparisons of

under suitable dry soil conditions is important to maintain a good soil struc-
ture and avoid soil compaction. Ideally, residues should be incorporated
when the soil is dry, but with expected rain ahead in arid and semiarid re-
gions, as water stress at the time of residue incorporation slows down its
mineralization by the soil microbial community ( Manzoni et al., 2012 ;

"3.5. Interactions with fertilisation
Studies using15N-labelled fertilisers applied in combination with
crop residues have found that the fertiliser is the dominant source
of N 2O(Machado et al., 2021 ). When N fertilisers are applied with
crop residues (particularly matu re residues with a high C:N ratio),
part of the available N from the fertiliser can be immobilized due to
the supply of organic C from the residues. Accordingly, the availabil-
ity of soil mineral N and the release of N 2O from the soil are reduced.
This is consistent with studies t hat have shown a reduction in N 2O
emissions if crop residues and fertiliser N are applied at the same
time ( Xu et al., 2019 ). However, other studies have shown that N 2O
emissions can be increased where a combination of fertiliser and res-
idues are applied to soil ( Abalos et al., 2013 ). It is likely that these
different outcomes are explained by the type of residues returned",ts/A review and meta-analysis of mitigation measures for nitrous oxide.pdf,5
"idues are applied to soil ( Abalos et al., 2013 ). It is likely that these
different outcomes are explained by the type of residues returned
and associated net immobilization/mineralization processes, as ex-
plained above. Other controlling factors may be the fertiliser form
(e.g., granule or liquid), and the spatial distribution of the fertiliser
and the residues in the soil, as these factors determine the physical
interaction between them.
We found a greater increase in N 2O emissions induced by crop res-

possible that this result is due to a confounding effect between",ts/A review and meta-analysis of mitigation measures for nitrous oxide.pdf,5
"and associated N 2O emissions ( Decock, 2014 ). However, it is also
possible that this result is due to a confounding effect between
fertiliser type and residue type, since most crop residues linked to
organic fertiliser application in o ur database were immature crops
(grasslands, vegetables and cover crops), which induce higher N 2O
emissions. Even if organic fertilisers increase N 2O emissions
from crop residues, their use is crucial for the delivery of other
agroecosystem services. This is because organic fertilisers provide
several nutrients (e.g., P, K) in addition to N, and may increase SOC
and yield in poor soils. Using organic fertilisers avoids energy con-
sumption and emissions of GHGs during the industrial Haber-Bosch
process of N- ﬁxation for synthetic fertiliser production and promotes
circularity of nutrients at farm to regional scale.3.6. Residue removal, transformation, and return under other forms

3.6.1. Biochar
A potential strategy to mitigate N 2O emissions from crop residues is to
turn them into biochar, and then apply this material to the ﬁeld. Biochar
is the C-rich product derived from biomass pyrolysis of organic feedstocks,
such as crop residues. Recent meta-analyses have shown that biochar can
decrease N 2O emissions after application with an average reduction of
about 20% ( Shakoor et al., 2021 ); however, a meta-analysis of ﬁeld studies
across several cropping systems, including maize, wheat, rice, vegetables,
and pasture showed no robust evidence for emissions reductions despite
tendencies for reductions of up to 17% ( Verhoeven et al., 2017 ). The pro-
cesses by which biochar affects N 2O emissions remain poorly understood

"cesses by which biochar affects N 2O emissions remain poorly understood
(Cayuela et al., 2014 ) and may, in addition to changes in chemical and
physical soil structure, involve changes in the soil microbial community af-
fecting N 2O reducers ( Krause et al., 2018 ). The pyrolysis process will re-
move most of the N from the biochar, and the resulting biochar material
degrades very slowly in soil and has negligible N fertilisation effects. There-
fore, N in the removed crop residues needs to be substituted by other N
sources, typically fertiliser N.
The use of biochar presents numerous positive side-effects. The pyroly-
sis process produces gas that may be used for producing fuels or heat for
substituting fossil fuels. Biochar has been shown to be stable in soil, and itmay also contribute to stabilisation of existing soil organic C, having overall
positive effects on soil C sequestration ( Wang et al., 2016 ). In addition, bio-",ts/A review and meta-analysis of mitigation measures for nitrous oxide.pdf,5

char application will in general improve soil physical and chemical proper-
ties such as increasing the pH of acidic soils, water and nutrient retention,
and cation exchange capacity ( Biederman and Harpole, 2013 ;Borchard
et al., 2019 ). This may lead to improved crop yields, where such soil prop-
erties are currently limiting crop growth and yield ( Majunder et al., 2019 ).
A recent meta-analysis has shown that biochar addition reduced nitrate
leaching by on average 13% ( Borchard et al., 2019 ), but only in arable
farming and vegetable cropping, with no effects in perennial cropping sys-
tems.

cation costs, and the fact that the process of biochar production largely

other sources; however, the greater retention of nutrients in biochar
amended soils may reduce the long-term effects of this reduction in N in-
puts ( Biederman and Harpole, 2013 ). Another negative effect of removing
crop residues for production of biochar is the lower inputs of metabolizable
C that can support macro- and micro-fauna, and this may have longer term
negative effects on soil biodiversity and soil functions ( Tibbett et al., 2020 ).
3.6.2. Anaerobic digestion
Crop residues may be collected and treated by anaerobic digestion,
alone or together with livestock manure, to produce biogas and (co)
digestates. The speci ﬁcs of biogas treatment, however, will depend on the
biomass processed. Considerable efforts have been made to exploit ﬁbre-
rich crop residues such as straw from rapeseed, maize, wheat, rice, and

on the soil microbial community is limited. This also means that soils stay
aerobic following anaerobic digestate application, which reduces the po-
tential to stimulate N 2O emissions ( Brozyna et al., 2013 ). However, it
should be acknowledged that residual (particulate) organic matter in
digestates has a high water retention capacity compared to bulk soil and,
if co-digested with livestock manure, will give N-rich organic hotspots
that may still have a potential for high N 2O emissions ( Baral et al., 2017 ).
Therefore, the balance between stimulation or reduction of soil N 2Oe m i s -

ditions ( Thomsen et al., 2010 ;Li et al., 2016 ).

a higher proportion of N in mineral form available for plant uptake

apply when immature crop residues are digested. Following biogas treat-

In recent years, the potential of nitri ﬁcation inhibitors (NIs) to reduce N
losses from crop residues has been explored. NIs were developed to im-
prove the N use ef ﬁciency of synthetic and organic fertilisers. Synthetic in-
hibitors such as dicyandiamide (DCD), nitrapyrin, and 3,4-dimethyl-
pyrazole phosphate (DMPP), operate by chelating Cu, which is involved

"pyrazole phosphate (DMPP), operate by chelating Cu, which is involved

and will cease with biodegradation of the NI ( Lees, 1946 ).
Numerous studies have shown that NIs can reduce emissions of N
2O
from nitri ﬁcation by inhibiting ammonia monooxygenase activity ( Byrne
et al., 2020 ), and from denitri ﬁcation and nitri ﬁer denitri ﬁcation by reduc-
ing the production of nitrate and nitrite ( Ruser and Schulz, 2015 ). When
used with synthetic fertilisers or manure, NIs often lead to 30 –50% N 2Or e -
ductions ( Qiao et al., 2015 ). It is therefore relevant to elucidate if NIs can
also mediate against emissions of N 2O from crop residues. Chaves et al.

ity can be inhibited by treating aboveground parts of grass-legume pastures
with DMPP prior to incorporation ( Duan et al., 2017 ). However, the effect
on N 2O emissions is variable, and effects ranging from 0 to 33% reduction
have been observed in studies simulating spraying of grassland with DMPP
before cultivation ( Duan et al., 2017 ;Kong et al., 2017 ;Nair et al., 2020 ).
Treatment effects depend on residue distribution, and on soil O 2and
NO3−availability, and together these factors determine the balance be-
tween aerobic and anaerobic residue decomposition, and the proportion
of N 2O being converted to N 2(Senbayram et al., 2012 ).

of N 2O being converted to N 2(Senbayram et al., 2012 ).
Since NH 4+is much less mobile in soil environments compared to NO 3−
or NO 2−, NIs can reduce nitrate leaching ( Qiao et al., 2015 ) and thereby sup-
port higher N use ef ﬁciency in crop production ( Abalos et al., 2014 ). As ni-
triﬁcation is also an O 2consuming process, its inhibition may also
substantially increase soil O 2availability for residue decomposition around
residue-soil interfaces ( Nguyen et al., 2017 ). Some aspects need to be con-
sidered before NIs can be widely adopted. The use of nitri ﬁcation inhibitors
represents a cost to farmers, and incentives could be necessary if introduced
for GHG mitigation. Cost estimates vary widely, from 10 to 90 €ha−1yr−1(MacLeod et al., 2015 ). The delay of ammonia oxidation can increase NH 3

mented for individual NIs before being widely adopted.
3.7.2. N-immobilizing materials with high C:N ratio
Co-incorporation of N-immobilizing organic materials with immature
crop residues can be a strategy to reduce N losses from crop residues
(Congreves et al., 2013 ;Agneessens et al., 2014 ). It has been shown that
materials such as immature compost with a high C:N ratio, straw, paper
waste and sawdust can reduce nitrate leaching under controlled conditions,
but the effect on N 2O emissions has not been widely investigated ( Chaves",ts/A review and meta-analysis of mitigation measures for nitrous oxide.pdf,6
"waste and sawdust can reduce nitrate leaching under controlled conditions,
but the effect on N 2O emissions has not been widely investigated ( Chaves
et al., 2005 ). In a laboratory experiment, Chaves et al. (2005) found that
co-incorporation of straw, immature compost and sawdust with residues
from celery reduced cumulative N 2O emissions by more than 50%. How-
ever, homogeneous mixing of the organic materials is important to obtain
N immobilization, and this can be dif ﬁcult to achieve under ﬁeld conditions
(Chaves et al., 2005 ), and such efforts may also increase costs and manage-
ment complexity for farmers. Depending on the characteristics of the or-
ganic materials and the speci ﬁc conditions in the soil, the N
immobilization phase could be followed more or less rapidly by re-
mineralization ( Chen et al., 2014 ). Thus, N 2O emissions could pick up in
the medium to long term.

the medium to long term.
Co-incorporation of N-immobilizing materials can lead to decreased ni-
trate leaching, and co-addition of organic C may potentially increase SOC in
the long term, with possible positive effects on crop yield in poor soils.
Transient increases in CH 4oxidation (sink) capacity in upland soils have
been observed ( Ho et al., 2015 ). As with mature residues having high C:N
ratios, the potentially negative impacts of net N immobilization need to
be managed carefully.
3.8. Crop mixtures versus single crops
Residues from crop mixtures may decrease (or increase) N 2O emissions
compared to single crop residues. The reason is that mixtures of crop resi-
dues with contrasting biochemical characteristics can promote positive or
negative non-additive effects on N release from the residues ( Redin et al.,
2014 ;Porre et al., 2020 ), with potential consequences for N 2Oe m i s s i o n s .",ts/A review and meta-analysis of mitigation measures for nitrous oxide.pdf,6
"negative non-additive effects on N release from the residues ( Redin et al.,
2014 ;Porre et al., 2020 ), with potential consequences for N 2Oe m i s s i o n s .
Non-additive effects are frequently explained by the nutrient transfer hy-
pothesis: decomposers ﬁrst use residues with a high N concentration, and
then the released N becomes available and facilitates the decomposition
of the more recalcitrant crop residue fractions ( Hättenschwiler et al.,
2005 ;Handa et al., 2014 ). Alternative explanations for positive non-
additive effects include changes in C:N ratios ( Zhou et al., 2019 ), improved
water retention due to one of the residues in the mixture ( Wardle et al.,
2003 ), and enhanced fungal decomposer community due to wider variation
in residue biochemical properties ( Hättenschwiler et al., 2005 ;Otsing et al.,
2018 ). Conversely, transfer of inhibitory compounds and/or phenolics be-
tween residues may cause negative non-additive effects ( Freschet et al.,",ts/A review and meta-analysis of mitigation measures for nitrous oxide.pdf,6
"2018 ). Conversely, transfer of inhibitory compounds and/or phenolics be-
tween residues may cause negative non-additive effects ( Freschet et al.,
2012 ). These interactions have been mainly studied to understand decom-
position rates and nutrient release from litter mixtures, but the conse-
quences for N 2O emissions remain elusive. In the few available studies
evaluating N 2O emissions from plant mixtures under ﬁeld conditions, the
contribution of residue-derived N 2O emissions was not determined
(e.g., Davis et al., 2019 ;Abalos et al., 2021 ). If future research con ﬁrms
the N 2O mitigation potential of residue mixtures, they can be implemented
in many agroecosystems: multi-species swards in grasslands, cover crops,
diversi ﬁed crop rotations (effects such as changes in decomposer communi-
ties are expected to act over longer time-frames than a cropping season),

"Plant species mixtures can provide a range of ecosystem services,
such as increased crop and forage yield, yield stability, pollinator diver-
sity and production, and weed and pest suppression ( Isbell et al., 2017 ).
Plant mixtures can also reduce nitrate leaching and soil erosion ( Gurr
et al., 2003 ;Leimer et al., 2015 ;Tribouillois et al., 2016 ), and increase
SOC ( J. Chen et al., 2020 ;X. Chen et al., 2020 ). The challenges of
implementing plant mixtures include, among others, development of
new machinery, dif ﬁculties selecting species according to local climatic
and soil variables, as well as adjusting N fertiliser management to multi-
species mixtures ( Abalos et al., 2019 ). These dif ﬁculties may reduce
adoption by farmers.

"Previous meta-analyses have found lower N
2O emissions after crop res-
idue application to ﬁelds for soils with a high clay content ( Chen et al.,
2013 ;Xia et al., 2018 ). This may be because high clay content
(i) decreases soil aeration and O 2availability, thereby decreasing residue
N release from decomposition ( Skiba and Ball, 2002 ), and (ii) lowers gas
diffusivity, promoting N 2O reduction to N 2via complete denitri ﬁcation
(Gu et al., 2013 ). This implies that avoiding crop residue incorporation in
coarse-textured soils whenever possible could be an N 2O mitigation strat-
egy. From a climate change perspective, this may provide a dual bene ﬁt:
ﬁne-textured soils, which have the highest potential to sequester C via
crop residue incorporation ( Hütsch et al., 2002 ;Mathew et al., 2020 ),

"may be the ones with the lowest N 2O emissions after crop residue incorpo-
ration, particularly if the initial SOC content is low. This needs to be con-
ﬁrmed in future studies, since the positive relationship between soil clay
content and the capacity of soil to store C is not always consistent ( Liu
et al., 2014 ), and because increases in SOC may eventually lead to higher
N2Oe m i s s i o n s( Guenet et al., 2021 ). From an implementation perspective,
farmers do not get to choose the soil texture of their ﬁelds, and therefore
any action to address this mitigation measure must be mediated via re-
gional, national and international land use policies. These policies must
consider other important side-effects of incorporating crop residues intothe soil according to soil type. Indeed, due to differences in water holding
capacity, crop residue retention may increase nitrate leaching losses in
sandy soils, while it may reduce them in loamy and clay-textured soils",ts/A review and meta-analysis of mitigation measures for nitrous oxide.pdf,7
"capacity, crop residue retention may increase nitrate leaching losses in
sandy soils, while it may reduce them in loamy and clay-textured soils
(Xia et al., 2018 ). In addition to higher soil C retention following crop res-
idue return in ﬁne-textured soils, NH
3volatilization from crop residues is
also lower in these soils due to higher CEC and ammonium adsorption by
clay particles ( Xia et al., 2018 ).
3.9.2. Aridity index <1v s>1
Recently, the IPCC guidelines for emission inventories divided the emis-
sion factors of N sources, including crop residues, according to an aridity
index (AI; mean annual precipitation to mean annual potential evapotrans-
piration). Higher emissions are assigned to crop residues in regions where
AI is>1 (0.6%; uncertainty range 0.1 –1.1%) compared to regions where
AI is<1 (0.5%; uncertainty range 0.0 –1.1%). A recent meta-analysis sup-
ports this decision ( Abalos et al., 2022 ), although the differentiation for",ts/A review and meta-analysis of mitigation measures for nitrous oxide.pdf,7
"AI is<1 (0.5%; uncertainty range 0.0 –1.1%). A recent meta-analysis sup-
ports this decision ( Abalos et al., 2022 ), although the differentiation for
crop residues may be stronger than indicated by IPCC, since N 2Oe m i s s i o n s
from crop residues were 2 times higher for studies conducted under an AI
>1. Consequently, limiting crop residue retention in regions where the AI
>1 could be particular important for mitigation. However, as with soil
clay content, this strategy to reduce N 2O emissions from crop residues re-
quires thorough examination before it can be implemented by national or
international land use policies, speci ﬁcally as side effects on soil C storage
are to be expected. That is, avoiding crop residue incorporation in regions
with AI >1 may reduce soil C ( Hu et al., 2018 ), and negatively impact soil
health ( Jansson et al., 2021 ). From a climate change perspective, AI is

"health ( Jansson et al., 2021 ). From a climate change perspective, AI is
projected to decline in some regions ( Lickley and Solomon, 2018 ), thus po-
tentially reducing N 2O emissions. For a given soil texture, with decreasing
AI, soil moisture is likely to be lower, and thus reduce the risk of nitrate
leaching losses from the incorporated residues.4. Future research priorities
In general, we argue that studies focused on crop residues should run for
at least 10 years, since changes in SOC and associated side-effects are slow
and likely undetectable over shorter time frames. Long-term monitoring of
N2O and N losses through hydrological pathways would also be required to
understand the impact of e.g., high C:N residues ( >30), and of adding N-
immobilizing materials such as green waste compost or sawdust on N losses
and to detect effects due to the possible re-mineralization of the
immobilized N ( Chaves et al., 2005 ). Such long-term studies should explore",ts/A review and meta-analysis of mitigation measures for nitrous oxide.pdf,7
"and to detect effects due to the possible re-mineralization of the
immobilized N ( Chaves et al., 2005 ). Such long-term studies should explore
the maximum amount of residues that can be removed from the ﬁeld under
given management and climate regimes to avoid soil degradation ( Merante
et al., 2017 ), and the potential for using surplus residues as biofuel feed-
stock. We also stress that existing long-term trials need to be continued,
but with a wider, multi-criteria focus, including GHG balances, nitrate
leaching, yields, pathogens, and economic assessments, and expanded for
different residue management options.
Up to now there is no targeted research available investigating the im-
pact of residue incorporation timing in relation to soil moisture conditions,

and risk for environmental N losses in the form of NH 3volatilization, nitrate",ts/A review and meta-analysis of mitigation measures for nitrous oxide.pdf,7

of residue removal or incorporation by ploughing) may result in decreasedN
2O emissions during winter and spring season freeze-thaw cycles
(Wagner-Riddle et al., 2017 ). However, more studies are needed to con ﬁrm
this mitigation opportunity.
For anaerobic digestion of crop residues, high pressure or temperature
(or additives) can limit the cost-effectiveness of pre-treatments of ﬁbre-
rich biomass strongly, but combinations of treatments hold some promise
for future developments and should be explored ( Yu et al., 2019 ). Harvest
time and composition of (low-quality and high-quality) crop biomass for
anaerobic digestion can improve biogas yield as well as nutrient availability
and soil biodiversity after ﬁeld application ( Drost et al., 2020 ;Fontaine",ts/A review and meta-analysis of mitigation measures for nitrous oxide.pdf,7
"anaerobic digestion can improve biogas yield as well as nutrient availability
and soil biodiversity after ﬁeld application ( Drost et al., 2020 ;Fontaine
et al., 2020 ), and this may also be true without digestion ( Struijk et al.,
2020 ). The consequences of these treatments for digestate biochemical
composition and associated effects on N 2O emissions after ﬁeld application,
remain largely unknown.
Cost-effective use of nitri ﬁcation inhibitors as a GHG mitigation strategy
will require a better understanding of which conditions support
nitriﬁcation-dependent N 2O emissions. This will likely depend on residue
characteristics such as C:N ratio and O 2demand, and on soil nitrate avail-
ability and O 2supply. Some plant species can produce secondary metabo-
lites that function as biological nitri ﬁcation inhibitors, although
mechanisms are not clear and results mixed; mechanisms may involve ef-
fects on N mineralization, as well as on nitri ﬁcation ( Pijlman et al.,",ts/A review and meta-analysis of mitigation measures for nitrous oxide.pdf,7
"mechanisms are not clear and results mixed; mechanisms may involve ef-
fects on N mineralization, as well as on nitri ﬁcation ( Pijlman et al.,
2020 ). It is also not clear if such effects persist when plant residues of
crops with ability to release biological nitri ﬁcation inhibitors are incorpo-
rated ahead of a new growing season.
Research should also consider possible means of reducing direct N 2O
emissions from immature residues. For example, immature residues can
be used as feedstock for protein extraction through biore ﬁning due to
their high N content, and the remaining residue fraction with increased C:
N ratio could then be returned to the ﬁeld. However, the economic viability
of this processes needs to be assessed. Another option would be to modify
crop biochemical characteristics either by breeding or with chemicals

termination (i.e., mowing, herbicide) affects residue decomposition and N
mineralization ( Snapp and Borden, 2005 ), but the resulting effect on N

standing of how farmers actually manage crop residues, as this would allow
for living lab approaches.
Unfolding how to manipulate interactions between different residues in

in microbial communities) may affect N 2O emissions, and to rank their rel-
ative importance. Then, we will be able to translate these ﬁndings into real-

regulators of residue interactions. Incorporating this information into crop,

is crucial to improve their capacity to predict the effect of crop residue man-
agement on GHG emissions, and therefore to design sustainable
agroecosystems under current and future climatic conditions.

tention, gas diffusivity or risk for nutrient leaching, and although at a global

"tention, gas diffusivity or risk for nutrient leaching, and although at a global
scale the relationships between N 2O and soil clay content are consistent,
several soil properties must be considered at a ﬁner scale (initial SOC con-
tent, gas diffusivity) before providing policy recommendations regarding

the relationships prove to be robust, future studies can use digital soil map-
ping (e.g., remote sensing, satellite imagery) to identify regional hotspots
for N 2O emissions from crop residues, and to propose management prac-
tices to minimize them. Similarly, the aridity index is effectively a proxy
for soil moisture content. However, the effect of AI and soil moisture on
soil C and N cycling is complex. Some studies have shown increases in AI

reduce N 2O emissions from crop residues may therefore depend on identi-
fying more speci ﬁc values across the AI spectrum, driving the magnitude of
N2O emissions released from soils.
More detailed, long-term ﬁeld studies are also needed to increase the ac-

fectiveness of each mitigation practice for crop residue-derived N 2O

of crop residues to national N 2O emissions represents a challenging emis-
sion source to quantify accurately, and the methodology used in national in-

"1. Introduction
In terrestrial ecosystems, soil stores the largest organic carbon (OC) pool
comprising over three times that of the atmosphere [1]. Small changes in
the decomposition rate of soil OC may signi ﬁcantly impact the atmospheric
CO2concentration [2]. Grassland ecosystems play a particularly important
role in the global carbon (C) cycle [3], with its C storage accounting for one-
third of the global terrestrial ecosystem [4]. An improved understanding of
the soil C cycle in grasslands is therefore essential for accurately assessing
its contribution to the global C budget.
Atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition in terrestrial ecosystems has in-
creased three times over the past century and continues to increase [5].N
deposition comprises both organic nitrogen (ON) and inorganic nitrogen
(IN) deposition. Although IN is the main component of atmospheric N de-
position, increasing evidence demonstrates the large proportion of atmo-",ts/exogenous N on C pool.pdf,1
"(IN) deposition. Although IN is the main component of atmospheric N de-
position, increasing evidence demonstrates the large proportion of atmo-
spheric N deposition accounted for by ON [6,7] . For instance, on a global
scale, ON deposition accounted for about 30 % of total atmospheric N depo-
sition [6]. Zhang et al. [7]monitored atmospheric N deposition at 32 study
sites over ﬁve years in China and, found that ON accounts for between 28 %
and 50 % of the total N content. However, few studies have focused on the
effects of ON versus IN deposition on soil OC in grassland ecosystems.
Nitrogen deposition can affect plant div ersity, plant biomass, soil C miner-
alization rate, and soil microbial activity, thus impacting C sequestration [8],
which has been shown to increase the decomposition of easily mineralizable
OC and promote the stability of refractory C [9,10] . In addition, increases in N

"OC and promote the stability of refractory C [9,10] . In addition, increases in N
deposition can signi ﬁcantly increase plant C assimilation and soil C sequestra-
tion[1]. While many studies have suggested that N deposition could increase,
have no effect on, or decrease the decomposition of soil OC [9–12].T h e s ei n -
consistent ﬁndings have caused uncertainty surrounding the soil C cycle in re-
sponse to N deposition. This discrepa ncy may be due to the different N forms
studied in the experiments. For instance, Riggs et al. [13] reported that ON
addition decreased microbial respiration of unoccluded OM by as much as
29 % relative to control plots. Chen et al. [14]demonstrated that ON addition
promoted C sequestration in temperate grassland soil. Chen et al. [15] found
that particulate organic carbon is more vulnerable to IN addition than
mineral-associated organic carbon in a soil of an alpine meadow. Therefore,",ts/exogenous N on C pool.pdf,1
"that particulate organic carbon is more vulnerable to IN addition than
mineral-associated organic carbon in a soil of an alpine meadow. Therefore,
the forms in which N is added to the soil should not be neglected in examining
the effects of N deposition on OC.
Soil organic matter is extremely complex; its formation involves a series of
physical, chemical, and biological processes. Based on different turnover
times and persistence mechanisms, soil organic matter can be divided into
particulate organic matter (POM; being predominantly of plant origin) and
mineral-associated organic matter (MAOM; derived from microbial residues
with chemical bonding to minerals and physical protection in small aggre-
gates fractions [16,17] . Generally, OC in the POM has a high turnover rate,
which is readily affected by environmental changes [18];h o w e v e r ,O Ci n

"which is readily affected by environmental changes [18];h o w e v e r ,O Ci n
the MAOM is more stable and has a slow turnover. Numerous studies have ex-
plored the effects of N addition on the change of relative OC content and the
change of absolute OC content, but the conclusions are inconsistent [15,19] .
For example, Chen et al. [19] found that N addition signi ﬁcantly decreased
OC in the MAOM, while Chen et al. [15]found that OC in the MAOM showed
no signi ﬁcant trend with increasing N addition. These inconsistent ﬁndings
highlight the need —in light of increasing global N deposition —for quantify-
ing responses of the OC pool distributio n to N addition. In the past, most stud-
ies on the effects of N addition to soil OC in grassland focused on one single

ON addition resulted in the accelerated transformation of recalcitrant com-
pounds into labile compounds and increased CO 2emission in forest soil [9].
However, the effects of different proportions of IN and ON on the soil OC
pool distribution and stabilization in grassland remain largely unclear.
Our objectives were to examine the effects of different types of N (IN/ON)
addition on (i) the soil OC pool distribu tion, and (ii) mechanisms controlling
its distribution in grassland. We teste d the following hypotheses: (1) the OC
content in soil and two contrasting fractions is signi ﬁcantly changed underthe addition of different N forms [15,20] , and (2) IN deposition exerts a
higher suppression effect on OC decomposition than that of ON deposition
[9]. We carried out N addition experiments in the Erguna meadow steppe",ts/exogenous N on C pool.pdf,1

2. Materials and methods2.1. Site description and experiment design
The experiment was established in a temperate steppe (N 50°10 ′;E
119°22 ′) at Erguna Forest-Steppe Ecotone Research Station of the Institute
of Applied Ecology, Chinese Academy of Sciences. The site has a cold temper-
ate continental climate, with a mean annual temperature of −2.4 °C and
mean annual precipitation of 360 mm (1950 –2017), which falls mostly
from June to August. The soil type is chernozem, and the dominant plant spe-
cies are Leymus chinensis andStipa baicalensis . We measured the basic chemical
properties of the 0 –10 cm soil in the control treatment in 2019 as follows:

In May 2014, we established 18 ﬁeld plots (6 m × 6 m) with six treat-
ments with different inorganic versus organic nitrogen ratios (IN:ON): the
control (hereafter “CK”), IN:ON =10:0 (hereafter “N1”), IN:ON = 7:3
(hereafter “N2”), IN:ON =5:5 (hereafter “N3”), IN:ON = 3:7 (hereafter
“N4”) and IN:ON = 0:10 (hereafter “N5”) at the experimental site, each
randomly assigned in triplicate (randomized block design). Buffer zones 1

"m wide separated the plots. We used NH 4NO3as the IN source, and urea
and glycine mixed in equal proportions, based on their N concentrations,
as the ON source. To the control plots (CK) we added only water. During
theﬁeld experiments, we fertilized each plot every May with mixed N solu-
tions to a total amount of 10 g N m−2yr−1. For example, the N2 (IN: ON =
7:3) treatment plots were sprayed with 20 L mixed N solution comprising
720 g NH 4NO3(the equivalent of 7 g IN m−2yr−1), 116 g urea (the equiv-
alent of 1.5 g ON m−2yr−1) and 289 g glycine (the equivalent of 1.5 g ON
m−2yr−1). N was applied once per year. It should be noted that these total
N addition rates exceed the natural deposition rates. The N additions of the
N2 treatment were largely in line with the average contribution of ON to
total natural atmospheric N deposition both in China (28 %) and globally

2.2. Sample collections
Soil samples were collected in mid-August 2019. In each of the 18 plots,
three soil cores were taken randomly at the depths of 0 –10 cm and 10 –20
cm (after removing surface litter) by a 5 cm diameter soil auger. These
three cores were mixed as a composite soil sample for the plot. The soil sam-
ples were kept in sealed bags and immediately taken back to the laboratory
for analysis. We carefully removed gravel and visible plant material from
the composite soil samples by passing them through a 2.0 mm sieve in
the laboratory. We divided the fresh soil samples into two parts, storing
one part at 4 °C and air-drying the other part. We determined soil pH",ts/exogenous N on C pool.pdf,1
"the laboratory. We divided the fresh soil samples into two parts, storing
one part at 4 °C and air-drying the other part. We determined soil pH
using a pH meter at a 1:5 (soil: water) ratio of soil and CaCl 2solution. We
determined soil microbial biomass carbon (MBC) and nitrogen (MBN)
using the chloroform –fumigation –extraction method [24]. We measured
both total C and total N contents in soil and soil organic matter fractions
(POM, MAOM, and MBC) using a C/N analyzer (Elementar Vario
MACRO, Germany). The total soil carbon was close to soil organic carbon
because the carbonate content exceeded the detection limit.
2.3. Soil fractions separation
We fractionated soil organic matter according to the approach by
Lavallee et al. [25]. Brie ﬂy, we dispersed a 10 g air-dried sample byM. Wang et al. Science of the Total Environment 858 (2023) 159919

and shaking it on a shaking incubator for 15 h at 180 rpm min−1. After dis-
persion, we sieved the samples and rinsed them several times with deion-
ized water to pass through a 0.53 mm sieve. We then obtained two soil
fractions: POM >53μm and MAOM <53μm. All fractions were dried in
the oven at 55 °C and recorded the weight of each. We determined the
OC content in the two fractions with a C/N analyzer (Elementar Vario
MACRO, Germany).

We conducted a short-term incubation to determine the potential of OC
mineralization. Brie ﬂy, we adjusted 25 g of dry soil to 60 % of the soil water
holding capacity with deionized water and placed it in a 125 mL bottle. At
the same time, we set three bottles without soil as the control. Before incu-
bation, we pre-incubated the soils at 25 °C in the dark for 7 days to establish

1, 3, 7, 14, and 21 of incubation and added water to the soil to a constant
weight each time. We determined CO 2emissions by gas chromatography
(Glarus 680 GC, PerkinElner).
2.5. Soil analysis and statistics
We calculated the percentage of POM and MAOM by the following for-
mula:
PercentagePOM¼MPOM=Msoil/C2100% (1)
PercentageMAOM¼MMAOM =Msoil/C2100% (2)
where MPOM(g) is the mass of POM fraction after fractionation, MMAOM
(g) is the mass of MAOM fraction after fractionation, and Msoil(g) is the
bulk soil mass before fractionation. The two fractions together constituted
total soil OC.
According to the OC content in the bulk soil (g·kg−1soil) and the per-
centage of POM and MAOM (%), we calculated the C in each fraction
(g·kg−1soil).

model parameters, we used a ﬁxedk= 0.025 d−1for all treatments and es-
timated C0for each treatment by curve ﬁtting.

fractions was calculated as follows [27]:

explain the lacking effect on OC contents ( Fig. 4 ), which contradicted ourﬁrst hypothesis. Previous studies have reported inconsistent effects of N ad-

with previous studies showing that a large portion of the OC in soil was as-

these results: Firstly, N addition stimulated the aboveground and litter bio-
mass [29], and N1 has the strongest effect in all treatments and is signi ﬁ-
cantly higher than CK. The increased POM fraction under IN addition is
likely due to the stimulation of aboveground plant C input. Secondly, IN ad-

Our results showed that OC in POM was more sensitive to N addition
than that in MAOM ( Table 2 ), which was in line with results from previous
studies [16,19,39] showing that the POM fraction was more vulnerable to
environmental changes, such as N deposition. In addition, the N1 treatment
had the strongest impact on OC in both POM and MOAM fractionscompared with other N addition treatments, indicating that mineral N addi-
tion increases C of both fractions ( Fig. 1 andFig. 4 ). For the 10 –20 cm, the
sensitivity differed for the two fractions ( Table 2 ), which may result from
less impact of the deeper soil layer from plant responses to N addition.

"tion, reduce microbial growth, and reduce soil respiration [19,40] .I nt h i s
study, the inhibitory effect of N addition on soil respiration was observed
(Fig. 5 ). Two reasons may explain the results. Firstly, the relative availabil-
ity of C and N affects the ratio of fungi to bacteria, which probably exhibits
systematic differences in growth rate, biomass turnover, and C utilization
efﬁciency [41,42] . Secondly, soil pH decreased signi ﬁcantly under N1
treatment in our experiment [29]. Soil pH has an opposing effect on the
growth of fungi and bacteria [43], which may lead to the inhibition of mi-
crobial respiration. In addition, Chen et al. [44] found that soil acidi ﬁcation
after adding IN exerts a greater control on soil respiration than soil N

"availability when subjected to long-term N enrichment. The close relation-
ship between soil pH and soil respiration can also explain why the topsoil C0
under N1 treatment was the lowest in our study ( Table 3 ), and the inhibi-
tory effect of IN on soil respiration was higher than that of ON ( Fig. 4 ).
The microbial metabolic quotient is the ratio of basal respiration to mi-
crobial biomass, which is an indicator of the activity level of the microbial
community [45]. With a higher microbial metabolic quotient, the carbon
dioxide emission per unit of biomass will be higher and the carbon use ef-
ﬁciency will be lower [46]. Our results indirectly indicated that N addition
decreased the microbial utilization ef ﬁciency of soil OC ( Fig. 5 ). Compared
with other treatments, the N1 treatment had the lowest microbial meta-
bolic quotient in both soil depths ( Fig. 5 ), indicating that IN addition
would be bene ﬁcial to soil OC sequestration. These results support our ﬁnd-",ts/exogenous N on C pool.pdf,6
"bolic quotient in both soil depths ( Fig. 5 ), indicating that IN addition
would be bene ﬁcial to soil OC sequestration. These results support our ﬁnd-
ings that the cumulative soil respiration was reduced with IN addition
(Fig. 4 ), because IN may inhibit soil microbial activities.
In general, our mineralization-related results showed that IN addition
inhibited soil OC mineralization and was conducive to grassland soil carbon
sequestration. This may be attributed to promoted soil acidi ﬁcation, which
could directly or indirectly affect soil carbon use ef ﬁciency and community
composition under continuous N addition [37,47] . Other reports conclude
that IN addition may inhibit the activity of enzymes related to organic de-
composition [9,48,49] , which may also explain the inhibition of soil OC
mineralization by the addition of IN.

"mineralization by the addition of IN.
The results imply that although the added different types of N did not
signiﬁcantly alter soil OC contents, long-term nitrogen (N) addition can af-
fect soil organic carbon pool within different soil fractions with different
turnover rates and reduce OC decomposition, which further affects OC sta-
bilization in grassland soil. For understanding the microbial mechanisms of
the in ﬂuence of added N on the soil OC pool distribution and stabilization,
future research should include an in-depth study of the effects of N additionon soil enzyme activity and microbial community.
5. Conclusions
Soil OC contents were not signi ﬁcantly affected by different forms of N
addition in our experiment. For different soil C fractions, IN addition signif-
icantly increased the C in both POM and MAOM fractions compared with
the control and the IN addition alone had a stronger effect. Moreover, N ad-",ts/exogenous N on C pool.pdf,6
"icantly increased the C in both POM and MAOM fractions compared with
the control and the IN addition alone had a stronger effect. Moreover, N ad-
dition reduced the microbial metabolic quotient and soil OC mineraliza-
tion. Overall, although the short-term (5-years) N addition had nosigniﬁcant effect on soil OC, the C distribution of soil fractions and OC min-
eralization was strongly affected by IN addition. Our results suggest that in-
stead of considering a single source of N (organic or inorganic), both N
types should be considered when assessing the responses of grassland soil
C cycling to globally increasing N deposition in a long-term perspective.

1.  Introduction 
In recent years, the concentration of atmospheric CO 2 has been increased due to human activities, It 
has caused a series of environmental problems such as global wa rming and greenhouse effect, which 
has made global carbon emissions control the focus of internati onal attention. Among them, the soil 
""carbon source"" and ""carbon sink"" function play an important ro le in global carbon cycle research[1].

"A large number of studies have shown that soil CO 2 negative flux is detected in the desert regions of 
many countries, such as the Unite d States and China. Its magnit ude is around C 100 g·m-2·a-1[2]. Such 
a large amount of carbon negative flux can be produced mainly due to the soil inorganic carbon cycle process in desert areas which have  sparse vegetation, poor soil and weak life processes.  
Wohlfahrt G L studied the soil in the American desert using hig h temperature sterilization to 
remove the biological effects of soil. And it turns out, after sterilization treatment, there is still a very 
obvious CO
2 negative flux which  proves that soil CO 2 absorption is an inorganic process[3]. In the 
domestic, Ma Jie also used the same method to verify that the i norganic carbon cycle of saline soil in 
arid and semi-arid regions produces a large amount of CO 2 negative flux, this indicates that the soil",ts/Review of SIC.pdf,1
"arid and semi-arid regions produces a large amount of CO 2 negative flux, this indicates that the soil 
inorganic carbon in arid semi-arid region has the potential of “carbon sink” in the process of modern 
carbon cycle[4]. However, the current understanding of soil car bon cycle mechanism is not 
comprehensive enough to understand  the transmission and exchange conditions and influencing 
factors of each source and sink[5]. Therefore, studding the formation mechanism of soil inorganic 
carbon and exploring the carbon sequestration is not only has a better understanding of the dynamic 
circulation of soil carbon storage in arid regions, but also ha s great significance for the study of global 
change.

inorganic carbon in the soil gas phase and the liquid phase is negligible relative to the solid phase, and 
the solid phase is the main composition of soil inorganic carbo n[7]. According to the source, the soil

"carbonates include the primary carbonate and the pedogenic carbonate. Primary carbonate is derived 
from a form of soil or parent rocks, which is preserved by an unweathered soil and has not been 
exchanged with the soil environment. Pedogenic carbonate is a product of the parent carbonate, which 
are dissolved in the atmosphere  and water by weathering into soil[8].  
The inorganic carbon balance process of CO 2(g)-CO 2(aq)-HCO 3-(aq)-CaCO 3(s) is commonly 
found in soil. The CO 2 from soil respiration and atmosphere are dissolved in water, at  the same time, 
hydrolysis of bicarbonate is converted into pedogenic carbonate s with other salts such as Ca2+ a n d

"Mg2+. Yang Lifang created five kinds of inorganic carbon formation mechanism model to describe the 
soil secondary carbonate formation, there were reduced genetic model, ascending genetic model, 
autochthonous model, biogenic model and frozen genetic model, and suggests that the formation of carbonate is generally produced by a model or model of the above[9]. Gile also established corresponding models for the formation and morphology of carbonate in desert climate, who 
suggested that the development of soil carbonate would be in fi ve stages, from filaments to carbonate 
sheets would take tens of thousands of years to form[10]. There  are many mechanisms of soil 
secondary carbonate formation, but the most basic reason is the  limited depth of soil water movement 
based on carbonate deposition and the higher seasonal evapotran spiration[11].

The reserves and distribution of soil inorganic carbon are rela ted to soil moisture, soil type, salinity 
degree and soil temperature. Especially in arid and semi-arid a reas with vegetation sparse, along with 
the changes in the state of soil moisture and CO
2 partial pressure, the dissolution and deposition of 
inorganic carbon in time and profile space reversible phenomeno n is very obvious. In arid and semi-

Xie Huailiang et al. studied found the soil carbon will be obvi ously leached as the water moves

undeveloped soil has a different degree of carbon loss, especially the inorganic carbon leaching volume is larger[13]. The depth of the soil water movement is l imited, so it can drive down the

to whether the process is a new source of greenhouse gas emissi on under environmental changes. To 
facilitate the understanding of soil carbon sequestration mechanism, isotope techniques and

The formation mechanism of soil inorganic carbon has gradually become clear as the soil inorganic 
carbon has been studied extensively. Especially in arid and sem i-arid regions, the inorganic circulation 
process of soil carbon has the potential of carbon sequestratio n. It is due to long-term human activities 
and environmental factors that causes the dissolution of soil s econdary carbonates and the repeated 
process of recrystallization, thus affecting the fixation and t ransfer of soil carbon. The change of soil 
inorganic carbon bank is closely related to the global carbon c ycle. It will be an important direction for

"Preface
Nitrogen (N) is one of the essential macronutrients which help in plant development
and also act as a limiting factor for plant growth. It represents about 2% of the totalplant dry matter that enters the food chain. Nevertheless, plants cannot directlyaccess dinitrogen gas, which makes up about 78% of the atmosphere. Plants absorbthe available nitrogen in the soil through their roots in the form of ammonium andnitrates. The limited bioavailability of nitrogen and the dependence of crop growth
on this element have spawned a massive N-based fertilizer industry worldwide.
However, the utilization of N-based fertilizers has led to many ecological problems.Biological nitrogen ﬁxation has come up as an ecological means to employ nitrogen
to the plants. Although plant growth promoting microbes are great nitrogen ﬁxer but

Abstract One of the important element for plant growth and which signi ﬁes soil
health is Nitrogen. Soil is majorly bound with inorganic (NO 2/C0,N O 3/C0,
non-exchangeable (mineral- ﬁxed) NH 4+, exchangeable NH 4+, nitrous oxide (N 2O)
and dinitrogen gas (N 2)) and organic forms (amino acids, amino sugars and nucleic
acid bases) of Nitrogen. Soil N amount depends upon N 2ﬁxation through microor-
ganisms, losses from leaching and crop removal, volatilization and Emission of N 2O
and N 2. Initially NH +conversion is processed through ammoni ﬁcation followed by
the conversion of nitrite to nitrate through nitri ﬁcation process. Further, NH +and
NO 3/C0are utilised by microorganisms and plants by process immobilization and
assimilation, respectively. In the end, the N cycle is completed with denitri ﬁcation",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,11
"NO 3/C0are utilised by microorganisms and plants by process immobilization and
assimilation, respectively. In the end, the N cycle is completed with denitri ﬁcation
process i.e. N releases back to atmosphere. Soil N is vast and not only related to
transformation and distribution of inorganic and organic N but also its interaction
with biosphere and atmosphere. The following chapter gives an overview of soil N
by keeping in mind to keep a detailed view of its distribution and physiology.

Next to Oxygen and Carbon, the most abundant element found in dry matter of plant
is Nitrogen (N). Being the key component of plant ’s chlorophyll, nucleic acids and
amino acids, N is acquired by plants in huge amounts from the soil compared to
other elements (Kumar et al. 2020 ). For all animals including humans the dietary N

"(protein) is provided by plant N. Through the process of deposition, the earth
receives the main forms of N (NH3, NO 3/C0and NH4+) from the atmosphere.
Deposition of organic N in the form of organic nitrates, particulate N (dust, pollen,bacteria) and amine aerosols makes up ca. 30% of N deposited in the atmosphere.Deposition of N in soils of forests is comparatively higher than deposition in manyother ecosystems, also deposition depends upon altitude of the place as it is more insoils from higher altitude than lower areas (McNeill and Unkovich 2007 ). In soil,
Nitrogen exists in various forms based on its different oxidative states (Robertsonand Groffman 2007 ). Nitrogen is a very mobile element as it circulates between
living organisms, the soil and the atmosphere (Mengel et al. 2001 ). Specially in

"Incubation method is often used to evaluate the availability of N in soil which is
based on the amount of inorganic N released when soil is incubated at 30/C14C under
moisture conditions of ﬁeld (Matsumoto et al. 2000 ). Many factors such as temper-
ature, soil type, wind, pH and precipitation can ﬂuctuate the availability of soil N
(Masclaux-Daubresse et al. 2010 ).
In soil N exists in many different forms and transforms easily from one state to
another. The path that allows N to ﬂow through the soil system ’s in and out is called
the“nitrogen cycle ”(Lamb et al. 2014 ). In ecosystems the cycling of N is divided
into an internal and external N cycle. Those processes that remove or add N fromecosystem comes under external N cycle. External N cycle include dry and wet Ndeposition, dinitrogen (N

N from one chemical form to another or to mobilize N between ecosystem poolscomes under internal N cycle. Processes involved in internal N cycle are rootturnover, mineralization of N (the process that converts organic Nitrogen to inor-ganic Nitrogen), plant assimilation of Nitrogen, return of Nitrogen to soil in plantlitterfall, nitri ﬁcation (NO
2/C0,N O 3/C0production from NH 4+or organic Nitrogen), N

important N transformations occurs viz., immobilization, aminization, nitrogen
ﬁxation, ammoni ﬁcation, denitri ﬁcation, nitri ﬁcation leaching and volatilization
(Yeasmin et al. 2012 ).

NO 3/C0, non-exchangeable (mineral- ﬁxed) NH 4+, exchangeable NH 4+, nitrous oxide
(N2O) and dinitrogen gas (N 2). Other biological or chemical intermediates, such as
nitrogen dioxide (NO 2), nitric oxide (NO), hyponitrous acid (HON ¼NOH),
hyponitrous acid (HON ¼NOH), hyponitrous acid (HON ¼NOH) and azide
(N3/C0) are also formed in the soil environment (Young and Aldag 1982 ).
1.2.1.1 Nitrate
In nitri ﬁcation process, the ﬁnal product is Nitrate formed after oxidization of NO 2/C0.
In soils Nitrobacter (the genus of chemoautotrophs) oxidizes NO 2/C0to NO 3/C0. Nitrate
production in soil is greatly related to the levels of NH 4+in soil, which in turn are a
function of the amounts of soil organic N, mineralization rates of soil organic matter,manures or crop residues or other wastes (Bronson 2008 ).",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,13

NH 4+or NO 2/C0in soils and also due to an overall negative charge possessed by the
soil makes it move freely within the root solution. NO 3/C0is readily available to the
roots of plant as it has high diffusion coef ﬁcient (ca. 1 /C210/C010m2s/C01)which also
has a consequence that it gets easily lost through leaching from root zone. About30% of soil inorganic N is lost per growing season through leaching which accountsfor the high losses of soil inorganic N. In soil, the diffusion coef ﬁcients of nitrate are
determined by charge, ion size, viscosity of water, soil moisture, temperature the soilbuffer capacity and tortuosity. Being an anion nitrate moves with seepage, surfacerunoff and subsurface ﬂow into lakes, streams, estuaries and groundwater (Bronson

1.2.1.2 Nitrite
In a two-step process of nitri ﬁcation, Nitrite is the intermediate product of NH
4+to
NO 3/C0. It is also known to be a small source for available nitrogen (Scarsbrook
1965 ). In soils NH 4+is oxidized to NO 3/C0
.The chemoautotrophic bacteria of the
genus Nitrosospira, Nitrosococcus orNitrosomonas oxidize NH 4+to NO 3/C0. Ade-
quate moisture and aeration is required for nitri ﬁcation to take place in soil. The
process is optimal at pH from 6.6 to 8.0 and at temperature of 30 –35/C14C. Nitrite does
not accumulate normally above the required level in soil and if its level is excess,then it would be toxic to plant roots (Bronson 2008 ).
Soil solution always contains nitrite. Laboratory and ﬁeld experiments have
revealed that in large amounts of nitrites gets accumulated alkaline soils whichmight get held up in the soil for long periods. High pH and large quantities ofNH

1.2.1.3 Ammonium
In soil solution NH 4+ion is found as a part of exchange complex and in positions
restricting its exchangeability (often called “ﬁxed”or“non-exchangeable ”). Only
small amount of ammonium is found in soil as it is in dynamic equilibrium with the
non-exchangeable and exchangeable NH 4+. Ammoni ﬁcation releases NH 4+in an
area where plant roots are permeated to absorbs NH 4+immediately and hence not
letting microorganisms to utilize the released NH 4+(Scarsbrook 1965 ).
Ammonium is a cation and hence it is attracted to soil particles which are
negatively charged. In soil NH 4+is held as an exchangeable cation and therefore it
does not leach easily. In aerobic (oxygen-rich) soils NH 4+is relatively unstable
(Walworth 2013 ). The relative concentration of NH 3and NH 4+is determined by
measuring the pH of the soil solution. Production of ammonia is favoured when the",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,14

measuring the pH of the soil solution. Production of ammonia is favoured when the
pH condition is high (Cameron et al. 2013 ).6 M. Shafreen et al.",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,14
"Concentrations of ammonium in agricultural soils normally are in the range of
20–200 μM. NH 4+is immobile in soil and is not easily lost through leaching.
Moreover agricultural, human and industrial activities (pollution) have resulted in
NH 4+accumulation. This makes NH 4+as the predominant N form with an average
concentration of 2 mM in some soils of forest up to 20 mM in agricultural soils. Suchhigh concentrations are may be due to anion/cation imbalance, problems with pHbalance and/or ef ﬂux of the ion which causes energy drain. The diffusion coef ﬁcients
for NH
4+and NO 3/C0are determined by charge, ion size, viscosity of water, soil
moisture, soil buffer capacity, temperature and tortuosity (Miller and Cramer 2005 ).
Fixation of ammonium in soils is widely differed depending on the clay fraction.

minerals and vermiculites predominate, NH 4+ﬁxation occurs in the range from
1 to 6 me. NH 4+per 100 g soil (Scarsbrook 1965 ).
1.2.1.4 Exchangeable NH 4+
The most important form of available N for plant is exchangeable NH 4+. Exchange-
able NH 4+is abundantly found in ﬂooded soil. In non- ﬂooded soils, both tropical and
temperate, extractable levels of NH 4+are less than NO 3/C0. This is due to biological
oxidation of NH 4+to NO 3/C0or rapid nitri ﬁcation. In soil, their sources include
mineralization of soil organic matter and plant residues and ammoniacal N fertil-izers. Slurries or fresh manures contain considerable concentrations of exchangeableNH
4+(Bronson 2008 ). Also, Biological immobilization processes requires
exchangeable NH 4+(Schulten and Schnitzer 1997 ).

"exchangeable NH 4+(Schulten and Schnitzer 1997 ).
1.2.1.5 Non-Exchangeable NH 4+
Non-exchangeable form of Ammonium ﬁxation is de ﬁned as immobilization of
NH 4+ions by the organic or mineral part of the soil in a manner so that they cannot
be exchanged by usual cation exchange method. Non-exchangeable NH 4+or inter-
calary NH 4+are those NH 4+which are ﬁxed by clay (Scherer 1993 ). Ammonium is
ﬁxed by clay minerals in non-exchangeable form at high amounts which are slowly
released into the soil thereby increasing soil N availability. Vermiculite, montmo-rillonite and illite are some of the interlayer regions of clay minerals where the mostﬁxation occurs (Cavalli et al. 2015 ). It is thought that the biological availability is
low to those non-exchangeable ammoniums ﬁxed in the lattice of clay minerals
(Rosswall 1982 ).

2008 ). Microbial role of N 2ﬁxation has a great role in biosphere nitrogen cycle.
Biological N 2ﬁxation contributes 83% and the fertilizers contribute about 14% of
total N ﬁxed (Weaver and Danso 1994 ). As O2 availability decreases the N 2:N2O
ratio increases and the ratio decreases when there is high NO 3availability (Jackson
et al. 2008 ). Two biogeochemical pathways that emit N 2O from soil are denitri ﬁca-
tion and nitri ﬁcation. Oxidation of ammonium (NH 4+) to nitrate (NO 3/C0) is carried
out by Nitrifying microbes, but during intermediary steps some N is lost as nitricoxide (NO) and N
2O (Del Grosso et al. 2000 ).
1.2.2 Organic N Compounds in Soil
Studies based on hydrolysis with hot acid revealed various proportions of organic N
in soil. Organic N exists in various forms such as amino acids (20 –50%), amino
sugars (3 –10%) and nucleic acid bases such as pyrimidine and purine derivatives",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,16
"in soil. Organic N exists in various forms such as amino acids (20 –50%), amino

About 90% of total N in soils accounts for organic N derived from microbial
decomposition of animal and plant remains. In majority of terrestrial ecosystems, themajor pathway involved in the supply of N and energy to the soil is from litteroriginating from both below- and above ground plant parts. Organic matter insurface soil contains nearly 0.4% dry weight of nitrogen (Green ﬁeld1972 ).
Organic N compounds in soil consist of 20 –40% of proteins, 5 –10% of amino
sugars and <1% of pyrimidine and purine derivatives and also a complex of few

classes based on the recognition for protein hydrosylates, i.e. (1) basic (diamino)-N,(2) ammonia and amide nitrogen, (3) humin-N and (4) nonbasic (monoamino)-N
(Bremner 1949 ).
Grassland and forests usually have high amounts of Soil Organic Nitrogen
(SON). Arable soils have high proportion of amino compounds. The range ofhydrolysable SON in arable soils is between 23 and 55% (Murphy et al. 2000 ). A
large proportion, about 20 –25% of soil N from surface soil recovered is in the form

NH 3. Some amino acids like tryptophan is completely lost during hydrolysis but
other like threonine and serine are destroyed partially (Stevenson 1983 ).8 M. Shafreen et al.",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,16
"1.2.2.1 Amino Acids in Soils
Amino acids in soil occur as proteins and peptides which are made up amino acid
residues covalently joined through amide linkage. Free amino acids also exist in soilbut in very small proportion which decomposed readily by microorganisms and thus
have a very short life span in soil. When mineral surfaces get absorbed with free
amino acids stabilization of free amino acids could be achieved. Sorption of freeamino acids to humic colloids or its retention in micropores or small voids of soilaggregates can also stabilize free amino acids (Deng and Dixon 2002 ).
Sources of amino acid N in soil are from plant debris, micro ﬂora and its products

Amino sugars can also combine with muco-proteins, muco-peptides, chitin and antibiotics. Amino sugars in soil are supposed to be originatedfrom microbes (Salton 1965 ; Coelho et al. 1997 ; Dai et al. 2002 ; Deng and Dixon
2002 ; Niggemann and Schubert 2006 ; Haynes 2012 ). Amino sugars in soil are
contributed by soil microorganisms. Bacterial cell wall ’s murein layers contain
Mur-N. About 3 –16% of amino sugar content is contributed by Mur-N and hence
it has been used as a biomarker for soil bacteria. The sources for GlcN in soil are1 Physiology and Distribution of Nitrogen in Soils 9",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,17

1.2.2.3 Nucleic Acid Bases in Soils
Nucleic acid and their products of decomposition becomes a portion of soil organic
matter in two ways. One is by introducing the nucleic acids of dead plant matter andits decay in the soil and the other is from nitrogenous compounds of microorganismsin soil. Proteolytic enzymes like trypsin and pepsin does not split the pyrimidinederivatives of the nucleic acids and its other products of decomposition but thecleavage can be done by the nuclease enzyme called Erepsin. Microorganisms alsoundergo a similar decomposition. From this it is clear that the decomposition of

purine and pyrimidine bases in nucleic acids of majorly from bacteria and smallfraction from plants. All of the RNA and DNA bases (adenine, guanine, cytosine,thymine, uracil and 5-methylcytosine) are identi ﬁed in the soil organic matter

1.3 Nitrogen Distribution
The top 6 inches of soil contain about 2000 –4000 pounds of N per acre in the soils of
sub-humid and humid areas of the USA. Despite this huge amount not more than 1%of total N would be available at any time. Above every acre of earth ’s surface nearly
35,000 tons of N is present. This N is present in the form of elemental nitrogen.",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,18
"35,000 tons of N is present. This N is present in the form of elemental nitrogen.
Signi ﬁcantly the availability of N in cold soils is reduced. At high temperatures the
rate of ammoni ﬁcation has increased notably in SOM. In tropical soils the available
form of N is often accumulated under a mulch during dry season. In 1945 Gilbertfound that the nitrate content in mulch soils was double the amount than in bare soils.When moisture content is high under the mulch seems to support mineralization oforganic N to a great extent. Due to leaching nitrate content under mulch lower thanthe nitrate content in bare soils during rainy periods. The in ﬁltration rate of mulched
soils is greater than bare soils which allow the soluble nitrogen to leach out

Riparian zone ecotones, waterside (including mires and reservoirs) ecotones,
surface water/ground water ecotones, fountain head water ecotones are the four
inland/land water ecotones that are distinguished based on landscape functions.Inland/land water ecotones are able to retain ground water and surface water tosome extent and most of the materials are removed from land sources. The amount ofN retained in waterside and natural wetlands ecotones depend on the biological andhydraulic characteristics that range between 10 and 90% (Bai et al. 2004 ).

depth of 100 cm about 8.3 Pg of N is stored in soil. A comparatively contrast value of7.4 Pg was estimated by Yang et al. ( 2007 ) using the data from 3283 soil pro ﬁles.
A large amount of N in soil exist in combined form which is bound to mineral
material and organic matter, but per acre only few pounds mineral N exists inavailable forms (as exchangeable ammonium and as nitrates) (Nie et al. 2017 ). It

Subsoil arid zones contain nearly 104 kg N per hectare which is about 3 –16% N
globally. In desert soils, the long-term leaching has led to accumulation of nitrate inthe subsoil region. In desert ecosystems, the natural sources of nitrogen include
NH
4+and NO 3/C0in eolian deposition, precipitation of nitrate salts and also in N
ﬁxing organisms. The maximum concentrations of NO 3/C0N in the subsoil of the
vegetation communities where nutrient is limited may exceed 2000 mg liter/C01.
Evidently, not all NO 3/C0N is consumed in the soil zone, once NO 3/C0gets concentrated

microbial and plant activities. General trends are observable even with the largevariability. For example, Lowest NO

N cycle is one of the complex biogeochemical cycles on earth, where it transforms
into various forms with the help of specialized microorganisms (Fig. 1.1). N cycle
involves a reservoir of its different forms in oceans, atmosphere, sediments, soils andthe crust. The main environmental and evolutionary signi ﬁcance of N cycle is to
maintain the availability of ﬁxed N to the biota. Most of the earth ’s atmosphere
constitutes free N
2but it is only accessible to N 2ﬁxing organisms and not to all kinds
of prokaryotes, where it is reduced to ammonium. Other prokaryotes and someeukaryotes require ﬁxed N (also called combined or reactive nitrogen) in forms of
organic N, ammonium or nitrate for assimilation.

"organic N, ammonium or nitrate for assimilation.
The balance between the ﬁxation of atmospheric N and recycling the ﬁxed
nitrogen to dinitrogen gas controls the ﬁxed nitrogen ’s availability. In terrestrial
environments, now more nitrogen is ﬁxed through industrial production of fertilizers
(140 TgNyear
/C01) than the amount of N produced through natural sources
(110 TgNyear/C01). Human activities also contribute in ﬁxing atmospheric N through
legume cultivation which forms symbioses with nitrogen- ﬁxing bacteria (Thamdrup
2012 ).

"N cycle in soil is very essential in determining the rate of N cycle in the
ecosystem. Most of the soil N is present in dead organic matter, in an insolubleform which is then converted to DON (dissolved organic N). In order to overcome C
limitation, DON is broken down by microbes from which C skeleton is used for their
growth and hence ammonium is secreted into the soil. This process is known asammoni ﬁcation or nitrogen mineralization. A part of NH

immobilization or the clay minerals absorb it or even assimilated by plants, whereasthe other part is oxidized to nitrite (NO

Through 15N isotope tracing experiments a close relationship between nitri ﬁca-

through denitri ﬁcation. In general, natural forest ecosystems have less losses of N

denitri ﬁcation have been reported and even in tropical forests which are rich N, N 2O
emissions are as less as 2 kg N hm/C02year/C01. Long-term deposition of excess N in
forest ecosystems has expected to increase NO and N 2O emissions to atmosphere

from which N 2gas is produced as an end product of denitri ﬁcation and goes back to
the atmosphere thereby closing the N cycle (Hofman and Van Cleemput 2004 ).
Transformation of N and its loss from soil is all interconnected by the role of
biotic and abiotic factors of soil. Abiotic factors like porosity, pH and temperaturecontrol N leaching and nitri ﬁcation (Van Groenigen et al. 2015 ).

catalyses the reduction of the ATP dependant reaction, where N 2is reduced to NH3.

One of the greatest advances of the twentieth century is the development of industrial

effective process, this process demands more energy. In Haber –Bosch process, N 2

atmospheric N 2combines with H 2at a temperature of 600/C14C and/C20106 kPa and

Presently, 90 million tonnes of nitrogen fertilizers are being added to agricultural
ﬁelds every year. In several countries, the addition of N fertilizers to agricultural

"1.4.2 Nitrogen Mineralization
N mineralization is a process of converting organic N to inorganic N (NH 4+/C0N and
NO 3/C0/C0N) aided by soil animals and microbes. N mineralization is in ﬂuenced by
many factors like organic matter content (Table 1.3), soil type, total N availability,
ATP content, microbial N content, microbial respiration, water soluble N, pH, C:Nratio, soil moisture, temperature, dryness, lignin content, litter cellulose content,plant/soil interactions and inorganic nutrients supply (Bengtsson et al. 2003 ). In soil,
the form of nitrogen is in organic form which gets liberated to NH
4+/C0N through this18 M. Shafreen et al.",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,26
"process. In vegetation covered soil the concentration of NH 4+/C0N is very low as
5m gk g/C01. Its low concentration is not an indicator of low rates of mineralization, it
indicates either plant uptake or rapid nitri ﬁcation. N is required for growth of
microorganisms, and for mineralization or immobilization of N by microbes the
process depends on the C:N ratio of the substrate compared to the decomposerorganisms. The substrate is utilized for both energy production and synthesis of newbiomass (Jansson and Persson 1982 ; Rosswall 1982 ; Yeasmin et al. 2012 ).
In soil N cycle, N mineralization is recognized as the centre point which controls
the availability of N to the plants (Schimel and Bennett 2004 ). Factors in ﬂuencing
the N mineralization ’s magnitude vary with depth. Studies have con ﬁrmed that when
the depth is /C211 m, N mineralization decreases and concluded with many in situ and

"the depth is /C211 m, N mineralization decreases and concluded with many in situ and
in vitro approaches that when the depth increases N mineralization decreases rapidly
(Dessureault-Rompré et al. 2016 ).
When there is a large amount of N than the required N in decomposing material,
inorganic N is released with net N mineralization and if the decomposing organicmaterial has the exact amount of required N for the microbial biomass, it results in nonet N mineralization. If only small amount of N is present than the required N, thenimmobilization of more inorganic N from the soil should occur for the completion ofdecomposition process (Cabrera et al. 2005 ). The proteolytic degradation of soil
peptides and proteins is usually related to be the rate-limiting step in N mineraliza-
tion (Lipson and Näsholm 2001 ).

lization is performed by this group whereas mineralization is done by the ﬁrst group

When gross mineralizationsurpasses gross immobilization, inorganic N in the soil is increases and called asnet mineralization. While in vice versa condition, inorganic N in the soil get

Immobilization and mineralization are performed by wide range of microorgan-isms—anaerobes, aerobes, bacteria and fungi. Soil fauna also has important role in
immobilization and mineralization processes. The quality and quantity of detritalinputs in soils are the important factors controlling the patterns and rates of immo-bilization and mineralization. When there is favourable temperature and moisture,microbial activity at high rates are led by organic matter which result in high rates ofimmobilization and mineralization. As a general thumb rule immobilization is
stimulated in material when the ratio of C:N >25:1 and when C:N ratio <25:1
mineralization is stimulated. Highly decomposed substances are the only exceptionto this rule as the C:N ratio is very low, and only complex forms of C remains whichis resistant to decomposition and mineralization (Robertson and Groffman 2007 ).

In the process of nitri ﬁcation, reduced forms of nitrogen are oxidized to nitrate with
the help of autotrophic nitrite oxidizers, autotrophic ammonia oxidizers and hetero-trophic nitri ﬁers (Fig. 1.2). Under aerobic conditions, based on the capacity to
oxidize ammonia to nitrite, autotrophic nitrite and ammonia oxidizers are character-
ized. The reduced forms of N in soil are mainly from decomposition and excretion oforganic nitrogen derived from plants and animals and from ammonia-based fertil-izers. Ammonium is required by plants and many microorganisms for growth whilenitrite is assimilated by others. Although ammonia has the tendency to bind with soilparticles, the conversion of ammonia to nitrite results in losses of soil N throughdentri ﬁcation where it is converted to gaseous forms and leaching.

gases are produced by nitri ﬁers (Prosser 2005 ). The formation of nitrite is initiated
by one group of ammonium oxidizers and once nitrite is formed, the second groupoxidizes nitrite to nitrate thereby completing the nitri ﬁcation process (Haynes 2012 ).20 M. Shafreen et al.",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,28

In soils both nitri ﬁcation and denitri ﬁcation occur simultaneously since the most
soils contain anaerobic as well as anaerobic zones. They are considered to becoupled processes as nitrite does not persist for a long time in soil. The autotrophicoxidation of nitrite to nitrate occurs at a faster rate in well-aerated soils that areunfertilized. This rate is even faster than the formation of nitrite from ammonium and
hence the concentration of nitrite in soils is low ( <1μgg–1). There is a group of
nitrifying organisms in soils which are called autotrophic ammonia oxidisers. Therole of these organisms is to oxidize ammonium to nitrite and followed by reductionof nitrite to nitrous oxide and dinitrogen gas. This process is called nitri ﬁer denitri-

1.5 In ﬂuence of C/N Ratio
Models predicting N retention and turnover in soils showed that C/N ratio is the
important factor in controlling the rates of immobilization, mineralization andnitriﬁcation. Soil C/N ratio is used to predict the variations in N immobilization
and mineralization is based on the fact that heterotrophic bacteria inhabit the soilwhich has high C/N ratio than the C/N ratio that the bacteria contains. Rate of Nimmobilization is used to characterize the soil, rapid immobilization means the soil
has high C/N ratio whereas slow N immobilization occurs in the soils where there is

Mineralization is dominated over immobilization in soils and residues where the

2O emissions and denitrifying reactions. When the soil contains
straw with low C/N ratio or no straw, N immobilization does not occur and there will
be more N available for denitri ﬁcation and nitri ﬁcation process and also high
amounts of N 2O will be emitted (Scarsbrook 1965 ; Piñeiro et al. 2010 ; Signor and

Plants acts as both a sink as well as a source for ammonia.Emissions depend on various factors like N content, plant age and leaf NH

3/C0leaching.
The determination of optimum rate is hard as mineralization of organically
combined Νmust occur before it is taken by plant or being subjected to leaching.
Thus, the rate of mineralization is the key factor to estimate optimum rate of
application. As crop growth is increased by irrigation the amount of N uptake isalso increased. Leaching losses can be reduced when optimum amount of water issupplied for crop growth. Many cases have been reported that irrigation increasesNO
3/C0leaching due to the passage of excess amount of water through the root zone
of the crop. The quantity of the leached NO 3/C0is greatly affected by the irrigation
method. The nutrients are directly removed below the furrow in case of furrowirrigation, whereas with sprinkler and ﬂood irrigation, the volume of soil leached is",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,34

"1.7 Conclusions
Nitrogen covers major portion of gases in air and one of the most important elements
in soil. The global N content is majorly regulated by what is happening in soil, asmost of the N in soil has various varieties and tend to go in lots of transformationsgenerally in organic forms. All processes involved in nitrogen cycle act individuallybut affected by other processes happening sequentially. Apart from environmental Ncycle, there is a separate cycle for N in soil known as internal “N cycle ”. Continuous
transformation of N occurs through organic and inorganic forms by mineralization-immobilization processes. Soils N content changes greatly, and many factors such as
temperature, soil type, wind, pH and precipitation ﬂuctuates its availability. In",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,35
"temperature, soil type, wind, pH and precipitation ﬂuctuates its availability. In
uncultivated lands, the soil N availability is administered through soil-formingfactors. But during cultivation the soil N level declines and reaches to new equilib-rium level. Though lot of studies have already been done for estimating N distribu-tion and its physiology in environment, but still more studies are needed in thecurrent situation of global warming. In future, various processes of nitrogen cyclelike nitri ﬁcation, denitri ﬁcation, immobilization, mineralization, etc. are needed to
be analysed and the soil N content should be monitored for effective sustainable
agricultural practices. The area of soil N loss due to denitri ﬁcation and leaching also
need attention and studies should focus on how to manipulate N cycle to reduces Nlosses and af ﬁrm that the plants will get adequate amount of available N. Not only",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,35

we need to research more about environment friendly fertilizers but also shouldfocus on the use of technology which ensure effective release of the N equivalent toplant N uptake.

Abstract Nitrogen (N) is one of the essential elements for life on Earth and is
mainly distributed in an inert form in the atmosphere, so it cannot be used by plants.
Therefore, the N found in the atmosphere must undergo several transformations to be
ﬁxed in the soil and then used by plants. With the presence of N in several organic
molecules, the acquisition of this element by plants has an impact on the growth and
development of several agricultural crops. Understanding the metabolic mechanisms
related to N and the methods of uptake, transport and use of this nutrient by plants

"related to N and the methods of uptake, transport and use of this nutrient by plants
have always been a topic of interest in several types of research. N also in ﬂuences the
soil microbiota, because microorganisms participate in the N cycle, especially in
relation to the process of biological application of N. Thus, with the discovery of
N-ﬁxing microorganisms, it was possible to explore the impact that the microbiota
would have on the plant ’s N metabolism. In this context, we have gathered in this
chapter, information about the ecophysiology of N in plants and how some fungi and
bacteria are able to in ﬂuence the metabolism of this element. We also explain a little
how the association between plants and endophytic bacteria occurs, since this
symbiotic relationship is very important to make N available to the plants.

2.1 Introduction
Widely distributed in the atmosphere in an inert form as atmospheric gas (N 2) and
found in a lower concentration in the soil, nitrogen (N) is considered an importantelement for life (Frossard et al. 2009 ). For N to be available in the soil and used by
plants, it needs to undergo speci ﬁc transformations in order to be ﬁxed or mineral-
ized and transformed into the form of ammonium (NH
4) and nitrate (NO 3), both of
which are absorbable by plant organisms, and for this reason, N is considered one ofthe most limiting nutrients for plant growth (Wang et al. 2019 ).
Due to the importance of this element in the structuring of plant organisms, since",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,41
"Due to the importance of this element in the structuring of plant organisms, since
it is found in several essential structures, such as amino acids, genetic material andphotosynthetic pigments, the methods to increase N availability in the soil are ofgreat relevance to the ecosystem, like the ﬁxation processes, in which atmospheric
N
2is transformed into NH 4and NO 3(Taiz et al. 2017 ). The availability of N in the
soil results, mainly, from the action of microorganisms, through a process called
biological N ﬁxation, usually performed by diazotrophic bacteria, which can be free-
living or associated with plants (Sylvia et al. 2005 ). Other organisms of the soil
microbiota that help plants through an endosymbiont relationship are fungi(Bonfante et al. 2019 ). These microorganisms increase the mobilization of N and
its uptake by plants, as they expand the contact surface of the roots and facilitate themobilization of NO
3and NH 4in the soil (Tao et al. 2019 ).",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,41
"its uptake by plants, as they expand the contact surface of the roots and facilitate themobilization of NO
3and NH 4in the soil (Tao et al. 2019 ).
With the action of microorganisms in the rhizosphere, the plant is able to absorb a
greater amount of N, causing the presence of bene ﬁcial fungi and bacteria in the
plant ’s roots to directly in ﬂuence plant growth (Tao et al. 2019 ). With the
higher availability of N, plants can use this nutrient ef ﬁciently, maintaining their
physiology in optimal conditions and investing in the production of amino acids,chlorophyll and plant material (Hallik et al. 2009 ). Some endosymbiont microor-
ganisms are also capable of increasing the production of secondary metabolites fromthe plant, removing toxic compounds from the soil, protecting the plant againstherbivory, increasing the plant resistance levels to toxic organic or inorganic com-
pounds, increasing the response to water stress and in ﬂuencing enzyme activity",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,41

Therefore, when considering that microorganisms in ﬂuence the physiology of N
in the plant, as well as its mobilization in the soil, we will address in this chapter theecophysiology of symbiotic relationships between plants and microorganisms inorder to understand their in ﬂuence and the impact that can be observed in the uptake,

In natural ecosystems, the sources of N are the atmosphere and the organic matter
present in the soil (Guignard et al. 2017 ). In the atmosphere, the abundance of N is
not directly related to its availability for plants due to high chemical stability,multiple transformations and interactions with other important biogeochemicalelements (Craine et al. 2015 ; Taiz et al. 2017 ). However, there are plants that manage
to establish a symbiotic association with N
2-ﬁxing bacteria (NFB), a process capable
of supplying more than 90% of the necessary N for plant growth and development(Valarini and Godoy 1994 ; Mahmud et al. 2020 ). The N in the soil originates from
the N
2ﬁxation and from the decomposition of organic matter, whereas the miner-
alization process is mediated by microorganisms that produce NO 3and NH 4(Taiz
et al. 2017 ).

"alization process is mediated by microorganisms that produce NO 3and NH 4(Taiz
et al. 2017 ).
For this, the metabolism of N comprises the processes of uptake, assimilation and
transport of the nutrient. These processes depend on several factors such as theavailability of N in the soil, location and regulation of the enzymes involved, as wellas the energy from photosynthetic processes (Masclaux-Daubresse et al. 2010 ). This
element has a direct effect on the distribution of photoassimilates between the
vegetative and reproductive part, promoting changes in the physiological and mor-
phological apparatus of the plant (Han et al. 2017 ), being related to gas exchange,
architecture of roots, nutrient uptake and cell development, as well as being presentin the molecular composition of ATP, NADH, NADPH, DNA, RNA and proteins(Masclaux-Daubresse et al. 2010 ; Guo et al. 2019 ).

"According to Williams and Miller ( 2001 ), plants absorb N from the environment
in several forms, including NO
3,N H 4, urea and amino acids, but they have a greater
afﬁnity for NO 3, since this ion is the end product of the microbiological use of
ammoniacal N. Both NO 3and NH 4are rapidly absorbed by the roots of the plants,
but the uptake of one form in relation to another is in ﬂuenced by pH changes in the
medium and also by the plant itself (Jiang et al. 2015 ).
To maintain the internal electrical neutrality in the cytoplasm when NH 4is
absorbed by cell, a proton (H+) is extruded into the apoplast, thus reducing the pH
of the medium, but when NO 3/C0is absorbed, a hydroxyl (OH/C0) or a (bicarbonate)
HCO 3is released, causing an increase in the medium pH. This action is possibly
associated with the competitive effects of H+and OH/C0on the NH 4+and NO 3/C0
absorption process, respectively (Lea and Morot-Gaudry 2001 ; Zhu et al. 2011 ). In",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,42

electrophysiological studies, together with the pH-dependent balance between theuncharged NH
3and the charged NH 4+forms, it is suggested that the ion is predom-
inant in all physiological conditions and is the dominant species in the controlledtransport of the membrane, since they provide the driving force for active in ﬂux and
efﬂux of ions and metabolites across the plasma membrane (Ludewig et al. 2007 ).
After being absorbed by the roots, N is transported to the aerial part of the plant by
the xylem vessels, via transpiratory current, but the way that N is transported
depends on the form it was absorbed, assimilated (incorporated into organic2 Ecophysiology of Nitrogen in Symbiotic Relationships of Plants and ... 35",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,42
"compounds) in the root tissues and transported as amino acids, by means of low
and/or high af ﬁnity transporters (Tegeder and Masclaux-Daubresse 2018 ).
The transport of N to the shoot depends on the plant potential for reducing NO 3to
NH 4. Once transported, the assimilation of NH 4into amino acids is attributed to an
enzymatic action involving glutamine synthetase, glutamine oxoglutarate amino-transferase and asparagine synthetase (Masclaux-Daubresse et al. 2010 ). Due to its
high mobility within the plant, N is easily redistributed via phloem, in the form ofamino acids. However, when the supply of this element is insuf ﬁcient due to a
nutritional de ﬁciency, the N of the older leaves is gradually remobilized to the
younger organs and leaves, coinciding with the reduction of the chlorophyll content(Maillard et al. 2015 ). It is important to highlight that the reduction of NO

"3/C0has a
higher energy cost and NH 4can become toxic to the plant, needing to be quickly
assimilated into organic compounds, so most plants preferentially absorb N in thenitric form (Turpin et al. 1988 ; Chaillou et al. 1994 ).
All inorganic N is ﬁrst reduced to NH
4+before being incorporated into organic
forms. NO 3is reduced to NH 4by the action of two main enzymes, nitrate reductase
(NR), located in the cell cytoplasm, which can use NADH or NADPH as a H+donor,
and the nitrite reductase (NiR), located within the chloroplasts (leaves) and plastids(roots), that uses reduced ferredoxin as an electron donor. NR catalyses the reduction
of two electrons for the conversion of NO
3to nitrite (NO 2), then NiR transforms
NO 2into NH 4through a reduction of six electrons and NH 4is converted to
glutamine, which is essential for the synthesis of amino acids via glutamine synthe-tase (GS) and glutamate synthetase (GOGAT) (Wickert et al. 2007 ; Taiz et al. 2017 ).",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,43

Thus, the regulation of N is in ﬂuenced by different metabolic factors, aiming to
adjust the assimilation of NO
3to the needs of the plant.
The N assimilation is dependent on the availability of electron-accepting mole-
cules such as glutamate and energy molecules such as NADH, ATP and ferredoxin,
supplied by photosystems in light condition. As a consequence of these needs, the
uptake of N has a strong link with carbohydrate metabolism, especially withphotosynthesis, since the N content can determine the amount of enzymes, chloro-phyll, NADPH and ATP available for the metabolism of the photosynthetic process(Nunes-Nesi et al. 2010 ).

2.3 Nitrogen and the Symbiotic Relationships of Plants
and Fungi
2.3.1 Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungi
Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) are microorganisms capable of promoting
symbiotic associations with plant roots, occurring in more than 80% of plantspecies and characterized by the presence of intraradicular hyphae, arbuscules,36 I. F. Matos et al.",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,43
"extraradicular mycelium and spores (Peterson et al. 2004 ; Bonneau et al. 2013 ). This
symbiosis is considered a cosmopolitan association and is recognized as an impor-tant and integral part of natural ecosystems of the world (Gadkar et al. 2001 ),
providing the stimulus for plant growth and a perfect morphological and physiolog-
ical integration, resulting from nutritional improvements, mainly the increaseduptake of phosphorus (P) and N (Cozzolino et al. 2013 ).
AMF can transfer inorganic N (NO
3/C0or NH 4+) to their host plant, but this
nutrient is transferred, predominantly, in the form of NH 4+. This transfer involves
a metabolic route, in which N is moved by AMF from the soil to the host, consistingof metabolic processes known to operate in fungi (the assimilation of inorganic N),together with a new variant of the urea cycle, in which the anabolic and catabolic
parts are separated by the long-distance translocation of arginine. This assimilation",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,44
"parts are separated by the long-distance translocation of arginine. This assimilation
of N into arginine allows it to be moved in a concentrated and non-toxic manner,making the transfer of N to the host plant with minimal loss of carbon to the fungus(Govindarajulu et al. 2005 ; Vergara et al. 2018 ).
These microorganisms, when inoculated in legumes, promote an increased capac-
ity of N
2ﬁxation (Veresoglou et al. 2012 ). According to Datta et al. ( 2019 ), AMF
together with NFB play an important role as symbionts of plants, due to their abilityto solubilize and absorb nutrients, obtain N from the atmosphere and still protect the
plant from abiotic and biotic stresses. Also according to these authors, in leguminous
plants there are several similarities in the symbiosis of NFB and AMF, mainly froman ecophysiological point of view, involving the search for macro and microele-ments of the mycorrhizal roots, essential for the functioning of N
2ﬁxation and the",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,44
"2ﬁxation and the
symbiosis capacity of NFB to obtain large amounts of N that in ﬂuence the supply of
photoassimilates to AMF.
It is worth noting that the participation of AMF in the N cycle can be variable,
helping to overcome stresses in plants and in ﬂuence the N cycle in the soil-plant
system (Hodge and Fitter 2010 ). For Veresoglou et al. ( 2012 ), plants colonized with
AMF have an increased root volume, which stimulates plant growth. Therefore, theN cycling processes can occur in a larger volume of the soil, as there is an increase,induced by the AMF, in the root size and surface areas, thus stimulating the Ncycling process. Another bene ﬁt associated with AMF is that plants colonized by
these fungi can reduce leaching of N, as they promote improvements in waterrelations, which include greater stomatal conductance and faster drying of the soil(Augé 2001 ).
Symbiosis with AMF can also have an indirect effect on the acquisition of N via
N",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,44
"Symbiosis with AMF can also have an indirect effect on the acquisition of N via
N
2ﬁxation. This effect is associated with a strong positive correlation of P supply to
plants, linked to the increase between the total P content of the plant and thepercentage of N ﬁxed, clearly documenting the importance of P nutrition in the
plant for the ef ﬁciency of NFB. Such fact was observed by Püschel et al. ( 2017 )
working with Medicago truncatula and Medicago sativa inoculated with
Rhizophagus irregularis ‘PH5 ’, in which the symbiosis improved the uptake of P
in plants and considerably stimulated the ef ﬁciency of NFB under low P availability.
However, even when the symbiotic microorganisms act in the mineralization of
organic to inorganic forms of both N and P, these interactions are not entirely2 Ecophysiology of Nitrogen in Symbiotic Relationships of Plants and ... 37",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,44
"symmetrical, because when affecting N ﬁxation, the supply of P affects the amount
of N in ecosystems, whereas additional phosphatases enzymes affect the rate ofcycling, but not the amount of P in ecosystems. Despite this, it is known that the P
cycle is closely linked to the mycorrhizal fungi, since they release extracellular
phosphatases, thus having a compensatory effect for the incorporation of theseelements (Vitousek et al. 2010 ; Spohn and Kuzyakov 2013 ; Guignard et al. 2017 ).
According to these ﬁndings, Javaid ( 2010 ) reported that there is generally a syner-
gistic interaction between NFB and AMF, resulting in better root nodulation,nutrient uptake, higher photosynthetic rate and plant yield compared to symbioticplants, with any single organism.
Thus, AMF can obtain substantial amounts of N from the soil, as well as from the
decomposition of organic materials and, consequently, enhancing their ﬁtness. So,",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,45
"Thus, AMF can obtain substantial amounts of N from the soil, as well as from the
decomposition of organic materials and, consequently, enhancing their ﬁtness. So,
the large biomass and high N demand of AMF represent a global set of N equivalentin magnitude to the ﬁne roots of the plants (Hodge and Fitter 2010 ), thus showing its
importance in the uptake and ﬁxing of N.
2.3.2 Ectomycorrhizal Fungi
Ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi, unlike AMF, are symbiotic microorganisms charac-
terized by developing their hyphae intensively around the root, forming a structurecalled the mantle, and only between the cells of the cortex, forming the Hartig net
(Peterson et al. 2004 ). These microorganisms are found mainly in forest areas,
preferably in association with woody plants, increasing the uptake of N and othernutrients from the soil to the plant, in exchange for photoassimilates (Datta et al.2019 ).

"The ecological stability of the mycorrhizal association depends on its competi-
tiveness in relation to a non-mycorrhizal plant, which in turn depends on the Navailability from the soil (Franklin et al. 2014 ). ECM symbiosis has a much higher
efﬁciency in the uptake of speci ﬁc N compared to non-mycorrhizal roots, especially
in situations of low availability of N (Smith and Read 2008 ).
In forests with limited N, trees depend on the decomposition activity of their
ECM symbionts to access N from the soil (Wang et al. 2020 ). In this process, ECM
fungi produce extracellular lignocellulolytic enzymes that depolymerize the soil ’s
organic matter, releasing N and transferring this nutrient to the host plant (Pellitierand Zak 2018 ). Even though ectomycorrhizae produce less lignocellulolytic
enzymes than their saprotrophic ancestors (Martin et al. 2016 ), they still play an
important role in releasing the N of mineral-associated proteins in forest trees, thus",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,45
"enzymes than their saprotrophic ancestors (Martin et al. 2016 ), they still play an
important role in releasing the N of mineral-associated proteins in forest trees, thus
inﬂuencing the biogeochemical cycles of forest ecosystems.
Paul et al. ( 2007 ) observed that inoculation with the ECM fungus Suillus
tomentosus inPinus contorta resulted in an increased nitrogenase activity, which
can be an important contribution to the necessary N nutrition in P. contorta . Also, it
has been demonstrated that inoculation with multiple mycorrhizal symbionts has agreat impact on NFB, and the use of mycorrhizal diversity can promote the38 I. F. Matos et al.",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,45
"efﬁciency of N- ﬁxing symbiosis for legume tree species (Diagne et al. 2013 ). Thus,
either alone or together with NFB, ECM fungi are extremely important in theacquisition of N for plants, since these microorganisms play an important role in
the dynamics of ecosystems, especially in forest environments.
2.4 Nitrogen and the Symbiotic Relationships of Plants
and Diazotrophic Bacteria
Leguminous plants have great importance in the nutrition of human beings and
animals because they are rich in nutrients, ﬁbres and low in fat (Kaufman et al. 1997 ;
Ponte et al. 2008 ; Kazydub et al. 2020 ;Sáet al. 2020 ; Zhang et al. 2020 ). In addition,
in agriculture, they stand out for not requiring a large external supplementation of N,since they are able to supply their biological need for N almost independently(Kakraliya et al. 2018 ). For this reason, leguminous plants have become a target of
several studies, which have shown that these plants have an endosymbiont relation-",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,46
"several studies, which have shown that these plants have an endosymbiont relation-
ship with diazotrophic N- ﬁxing bacteria, that supply much of the N necessary for

Diazotrophic bacteria were identi ﬁed from anatomical studies of leguminous
plants roots in the seventeenth century (Beijerinck 1888 ; Hellriegel and Wilfarth
1888 ). Currently, more than 19.000 species of N- ﬁxing diazotrophic bacteria are
known and characterized as sources of nitrogen accumulation (Azani et al. 2017 ;
Huisman and Geurts 2020 ). Although being free-living, these bacteria are capable of
forming an endosymbiosis with plants, known as rhizobia, characteristic for devel-
oping small nodules in the root tissue of their host, in which bacteria grow andexchange nutrients with plants (Huisman and Geurts 2020 ). However, the associa-",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,46

tion of NFB with plants occurs only in favourable conditions to the formation of thesymbiotic relationship, in which plants provide photoassimilates for the microor-ganism, in exchange for the N
2ﬁxed in the form of NH 4(Beijerinck 1888 ).
Several studies have characterized and described the genera and families of
endosymbiont bacteria capable of ﬁxing N (Burrill and Hansen 1917 ; Bruijn et al.
1995 , Beatty and Good 2011 ; Mus et al. 2016 ). It has also been determined that the
biological ﬁxation of N is not limited to the symbiotic relationship between plants
and rhizobia, since other microorganisms are also capable of transforming atmo-spheric N into ammonia (NH
3), like protists of the genus Frankia , either free-living
or in symbiosis (Vessey 2003 ; Pawlowski and Newton 2008 ; Sellstedt and Richau

or in symbiosis (Vessey 2003 ; Pawlowski and Newton 2008 ; Sellstedt and Richau

Bacteria of the genus Azospirillum are an example of free-living microorganisms
capable of ﬁxing N and forming bene ﬁcial association with plants. These bacteria do
not have high speci ﬁcity for their host plant and have the ability to promote N
ﬁxation without the need for N depletion in the soil to start the symbiosis process,
characteristics that differentiate these bacteria from the rhizobia group, being calledsymbiotic endophytic bacteria (Okon and Kapulnik 1986 ; Bianco and Defez 2011 ;2 Ecophysiology of Nitrogen in Symbiotic Relationships of Plants and ... 39",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,46
"Tewari and Arora 2013 ). The biological N ﬁxation performed by symbiotic endo-
phytic bacteria occurs without being organized into a speci ﬁc structure, such as
nodules. These bacteria are dispersed in the intercellular spaces of plant tissues,
where the N ﬁxation process occurs. Bacteria of the genus Burkholderia ,Delftia and
Herbaspirillum are also some examples of this type of symbiosis (Bhattacharjee
et al. 2008 ; Govindarajan et al. 2008 ; Morel et al. 2013 ; Ejaz et al. 2020 ; Romero-
Gutiérrez et al. 2020 ).
Considering all microorganisms present in the soil with the ability to ﬁx N and
capable of forming an endosymbiotic relationship with plants, rhizobia stand outmainly for the large amount of N
2ﬁxed and supplied to the plant, in addition to other
promoted bene ﬁts (Hansen et al. 2017 ; Wang et al. 2019 ). Thus, it is crucial to better
understand the impacts of rhizobia and the formation of nodules on plant roots

2.4.1 Introducing the Rhizobia Group
The name rhizobia refer to the order Rhizobiales, being a collective of 84 genera
divided into seven families of diazotrophic bacteria, capable of ﬁxing atmospheric
nitrogen in the soil in symbiosis with host plants (Gueddes et al. 2020 ). Some of

known genus Rhizobia (Epstein and Bloom 2006 ; Marschner and Marschner
2012 ; Gueddes et al. 2020 ).
Host plants that form endosymbiosis with rhizobia are known as the N- ﬁxing
clade, belonging mainly to the Fabaceae family and other plant orders such as
Fabales ,Curcubitales ,Fagales andRosales (Gueddes et al. 2020 ). However, it is",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,47

ness in relation to the nodular formation at the root, which varies according to each
species and the genes involved in the endosymbiotic relationship (Azani et al. 2017 ;
Huisman and Geurts 2020 ).
It is believed that this symbiosis may have arisen due to a common ancestor of
plants that had the ability to incorporate bacterial cells into their plant tissues, sinceall families in the nitrogen ﬁxation group belong to the same evolutionary clade
(Parniske 2018 ). Also, the discovery of the genus Frankia , which are microorgan-

ganisms (van Velzen et al. 2018 ; van Velzen et al. 2019 ). These microorganisms are
able to protect the complex of the enzyme responsible for ﬁxing N against oxidation,
which is a fundamental mechanism for ﬁxing N at its maximum capacity (Sellstedt
and Richau 2013 ).40 I. F. Matos et al.",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,47

reason that led to the formation of this connection between plants and NFB, it isnecessary to understand the basic mechanism of transformation of N

the nitrogenase enzyme, which is able to break the triple bond that connects the twogaseous nitrogen atoms. However, in order to be activated, the enzyme requires anenvironment with little oxygen (O
2) and large amounts of energy, in the form of ATP

symbiotic relationship between plants and diazotrophic bacteria, the full potentialof the nitrogenase enzyme can be reached, allowing biological N ﬁxation to be
maximized by bacteria (Boivin and Lepetit 2020 ). Therefore, plants provide ener-
getic compounds, as well as an environment favourable to enzymatic activity, while

compounds to plants (Dixon and Kahn 2004 ; Marschner and Marschner 2012 ;

molecules that act as a communication bridge between the plant and free-living
bacteria in the soil (Heidstra and Bisseling 1996 ; Mbengue et al. 2020 ). It is
important to note that the symbiotic relationship between plants and rhizobia is notmandatory (Marschner and Marschner 2012 ; Boivin and Lepetit 2020 ) since plants

of rhizobia-plant symbiosis does not occur spontaneously, since this symbiosis is not
considered mandatory (Tewari and Arora 2013 ).
In unfavourable situations, where the availability of readily absorbable N is low,
plants release exudates that act as chemical signals in order to communicate with themicroorganisms present in the soil (Coskun et al. 2017 ). These signals are carried out
by chemical signalling molecules composed of betaines and iso ﬂavonoids, which are
recognized by microorganisms capable of symbiotically relating to these plants.These microorganisms perceive the signals and release their own in response, which

Thus, for the establishment of symbiosis and the formation of an active and
N-ﬁxing nodule, two distinct and simultaneous steps are required: infection by

wall, differentiating into bacterioids and forming the symbiosis with the necessaryconditions for the activity of the nitrogenase enzyme (Poole and Allaway 2000 ;
Huisman and Geurts 2020 ). This enzyme is able to convert N
2to NH 3by consuming
ATP and releasing hydrogen (H 2), then NH 3is delivered to α-ketoglutarate/gluta-
mate to form glutamate/glutamine and is further transmitted to other amino acids andN-containing compounds in N metabolism of the host plant (Wang et al. 2019 ). The
structure and activity of the nodule have a de ﬁned useful life, because with a
decreased production of NH
3, plants and rhizobia coordinate a programmed cell
death through hormonal chemical signals, that act to initiate the senescence of thenodule, protecting the plant from a possible drain and ensuring the preservation of

2.4.3 Importance of the Plant-Rhizobia Symbiosis Formation
A major part of the N 2ﬁxed in the soil is obtained by the action of the symbiotic
relationship between leguminous plants and rhizobia, which generates approxi-mately 18 /C210
9kg of N per year (Sylvia et al. 2005 ; Herridge et al. 2008 ; Wang
et al. 2019 ). In addition, this symbiotic association has an indirect impact on the
ecosystem, altering the dynamics of the relationships between plants in relation to N
uptake in the soil, because there will be less competition between a plant with
symbiosis and a plant without symbiosis, allowing both to develop better and receivethe amount of N necessary for their metabolism. This happens because the directreceiver of the NH
4produced by diazotrophic bacteria in symbiosis is the host plant,
but the N ﬁxed by free-living diazotrophic bacteria is available in the soil and can",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,50
"4produced by diazotrophic bacteria in symbiosis is the host plant,
but the N ﬁxed by free-living diazotrophic bacteria is available in the soil and can
also be used by uninoculated plants, so both plants, in symbiosis or not, can acquirehigher levels of N from soil (Hodge and Fitter 2012 ; Liu et al. 2020a ,b).
Rhizobia also stimulate plant growth and productivity through the production of
phytohormones, nutrient mineralization, protection against pathogens and other
beneﬁts (Gopalakrishnan et al. 2015 ; Gopalakrishnan et al. 2017 ; Silveira et al.
2016 ; Jack et al. 2019 ). Thus, several studies seek to demonstrate the bene ﬁts of
using these microorganisms as biofertilizers, in order to reduce the use of syntheticnitrogen fertilizers, which make agricultural production more expensive and are amajor source of pollution, negativelly impacting the environment through eutrophi-cation of water bodies and reduced soil fertility (Tetteh 2015 ; Ríos-Ruiz et al. 2020 ).",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,50
"However, although already used in some cultures, further studies are needed to better
understand the af ﬁnity of plant species capable of symbiotically interacting to one or
more species of rhizobia, aiming to optimize the use of these microorganisms asbiofertilizers for agricultural production (Wang et al. 2019 ).

2.5 Final Considerations
N is very important for plants, being able to in ﬂuence several enzymes and even
affecting photosynthesis, since it is present in the main organic molecules, such aschlorophyll, ATP, NAPH and several amino acids. As a result, different biologicalmechanisms have been evolving to increase the uptake of nitrate and ammonium,which are the forms of N used by the plant and are also present in the soil in lessconcentration.
One of these mechanisms is the establishment of bene ﬁcial symbiotic relation-
ships with soil microorganisms such as fungi and bacteria. Depending on the
individuals present in these relationships, as well as their mechanism of action,",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,51
"ships with soil microorganisms such as fungi and bacteria. Depending on the
individuals present in these relationships, as well as their mechanism of action,
symbiotic relationships impact N ecology in different ways. In this context,arbuscular mycorrhizae are able to transfer inorganic N from the soil to the plant,while ectomycorrhizae are able to increase the availability of N in the soil surround-ing the host plant, thus providing the ecosystem with mobile forms of N through thedecomposition of organic matter.
In the symbiotic relationship between plants and diazotrophic bacteria, the
acquisition of N by the plant occurs by the action of the enzyme nitrogenase present
in the protist metabolism, ﬁxing N directly from the atmosphere. Thus, symbiosis
between the plant and the diazotrophic bacteria is considered one of the mainbeneﬁcial associations with a better quantitative result in the acquisition of N.
The different types of symbiotic associations in ﬂuence the nitrogen cycle at",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,51
"The different types of symbiotic associations in ﬂuence the nitrogen cycle at
different levels, since the acquisition and mobilization of the element in the soil –
plant relationships differ. Therefore, for a better understanding of this in ﬂuence,
several studies aim to understand the communication and establishment of symbioticrelationships, as well as the impact of this symbiosis between the two beings
involved. However, future studies are still needed to discover more ef ﬁcient ways
to apply the bene ﬁts of symbiotic relationships in agricultural crops, reducing the
need to apply external sources of N such as chemical fertilizers, which in excess canact as toxic compounds, decreasing the natural fertility of the soil and polluting largebodies of water.

In addition totheir complex web of interaction, various heterotrophic microbial communities in thesoil enable micro and macronutrients to be cycled through the soil ecosystem.

"is affected by plant inputs, and its chemistry also makes each environment and its
microbial culture very peculiar. While the function of the soil microbiome is wellrecognised, there is still a restricted understanding of its complexity. Knowingmicrobial diversity will therefore enhance our ability to increase agricultural pro-duction. In the past years, much emphasis has been placed on exploring and studyingthe active microbial population inhabiting the soil through increasing understandingof the potential of microorganisms. As a driver of biochemical processes that arebeneﬁcial to the natural world, soil microorganisms have taken on prominence since
the beginning of the nineteenth century. These microorganisms carry out various
processes in which organic compounds are depleted, components are recycled and52 S. Shukla et al.",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,59
"nutrient recycling is important for animal development, plant growth, and cultiva-
tion. However, certain microorganisms in the soil are dangerous to plant and animallife and function as pathogens that damage the host directly or introduce toxic
compounds into the soil. A better understanding of soil microbes is thus important
to understand their impact on agriculture and the environment. Therefore, theattention of soil microbiologists is not only on the diversity of soil microbes, butalso on their contact with the atmosphere and other organisms.

3.2 Soil Microbiology (Historical Perspectives)
The cornerstone of modern soil microbiology studies in the middle of the nineteenthcentury was set by Louis Pasteur, Selman Waksman, and Sergei Winogradsky. Oneremarkable research, among other studies Winogradsky was discovered as the fatherof soil microbiology, is the sulphur cycle, role of CO
2and inorganic ion for the
microbial (chemoautotrophic) and nitri ﬁcation. He was also privileged to be named
one of nitrifying bacteria by Nitrobacter winogradskii. Bacteria that were notsymbiotic, Berthelot ﬁrst suggested in the late nineteenth century, can achieve

Itwas also emphasised that it is more effective to add stable manure to the soil than toadd inorganic nutrients directly. The fastening of nitrogen by the leguminous plantsis one of the main microbial processes well studied. The soil fungal and soil bacteriastudies have laid the foundation for the modern era of microbiology and all these3 Ecological Perspectives on Soil Microbial Community Involved in Nitrogen ... 53",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,60

compost nitri ﬁcation and denitri ﬁcation and chemical transformations. The general
connexion between the soil microbial population and soil fertility has also given rise
to the notion of inoculating desired soil microorganisms (Kizewski and Kaye 2019 ).
In 1939, apart from the agronomical signi ﬁcance of soil microbes, S. With
Waksman and Rene Dubos ﬁnd Streptomyces sp., a soil actinobacteria (formerly
actinomycete) with antibiotic properties. Waksman received the Nobel Prize forantimicrobial soil microbes in 1952. Studies by Melin and Hayner on mycorrhizalfungi and Cutler on the actinobacterias of the soil extend the scope of the soilmicrobiology to include Krinsky, Conn, Waksman, and Curtis and on the groundprotozoa. Soil microbes have been extensively researched and introduced since their
discovery in diverse areas of human life. (Balser et al. 2010 ).

Since it is home to several thousand different species of organisms/microorganisms,
soil is an ecosystem that is not inert but dynamic. Soil microbes ’population,
structure, and behaviour are determined by their soil habitat. Grown land is rich inorganic matter and has a much greater microbial population than sandy or erodedsoils. The soil microbes breathe within this habitat, compete for food, cooperate witheach other, and respond to changes in their living environment.

In addition, fungal hyphaeand plant roots bind together soil aggregates that provide a positive atmosphere forplant growth. Rudakov et al. also suggested that active humus has an importantfunction in cementing soil particles into aggregates. For the most part, soil cementing
substances consist of (1) uronic acid derivatives, (2) bacterial proteins or products of
their lytic action, and (3) fungal culture lysates and/or colloidal protein derivativessynthesised by soil bacteria (Makhalanyane et al. 2015 ).

"Similarly, parameters such as temperature, moisture, and seasonal variations

carbon, depends on the (SOC). There is a greater amount of SOC available within the
initial 1 m depth of soil. The amount of carbon present aboveground is two or threetimes as much as (Brady and Weil 2002 ). Thus, the upper 20 –30 cm of soil where
abundance of soil microbial populations is present due to rich SOC is believed to bethe most biologically active region of the soil (Ferrari et al. 2016 ; van der Heijden

Typically, such a relationbetween true symbiosis, between bacteria root-nodule and legume plants, andparasitic phenomena, may be considered as midway. The key causes of the rhizo-sphere effect are the deposition of manure, decrease of the concentration of certainmineral nutrients, partial desiccation of the soil, and rise of soil carbonates after rootexcretion.

The soil may be treatedby sun, volatile antiseptics, or transparent lime, in order to maximise productivity.Soil microorganisms are documented to help plant seed germination and seed

produces unfavourable anaerobic conditions for the oxidation and germination.Recent experiments have shown that microorganisms can generate plant growthhormones and/or related substances.

While there are few laboratory studies indicating the effect of plant diversity on soil
microorganisms (Bargett and Shine 1999 ; Voytek et al. 1999 ; Smith and Smith
1990 ), there are grounds to believe that plant diversity can in ﬂuence the microbial
community of the soil biome. This is due to the lack of an experimental method to
provide access to the direct effect of growing plant or plant products on soilmicrobes. Mostly, the impact of plants on soil microbes is studied indirectly by(a) calculating the amount of microorganisms, (b) nitrifying and denitrifying soilenergy, and (c) oxidising soil power in terms of aeration or output of CO
2. Effects of
growing plants on the structure and role of soil microorganisms can be described as:56 S. Shukla et al.",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,63

solubility of certain inorganic soil constituents. Soil porosity and structure are modi ﬁed
and affected by the plant diversity. Sometimes, plants can hinder the growing of soilmicrobes by removing a considerable amount of moisture from soil.
The pathways for feedback between plant and microbial communities monitor the
diversity and productivity of plants. For example, soil bacteria are stimulated bycowpeas, ﬁeld peas, vetch, and soya. Among the bacteria, in particular, Radiobacter

This is clear from the fact that the pathogenic fungi population improves theecosystem of the soil through constant growing of maize, ﬂax, or clover. While
the roots of alfalfa have only a marginal stimulating effect on ﬁlamentous fungi, the
effect of the aubergines was important. A range of stimulatory effects on soilmicrobes by cultivating alfalfa, rye, and vetch plants are observed, ranging fromthe least to actinobacteria, slightly to fungi, and the highest to soil bacteria.

microbes need to scavenge N from their surroundings, which will help N stable intheir biomass.
In order to understand mineralisation-immobilisation the secret is to “think as a
microbe ”, i.e. to try and live by obtaining energy and C from waste. The detritus
often has all the N the microbe requires, so that excess N (mineralised) in the soil
solution is released when C is ingested. Detritus also loses enough N to satisfy
microbial requirements to immobilise extra N from the soil solution, because of thefeeding of C. Microbes have been seen to expend more resources in the synthesis ofenzymes (e.g. amidases to acquire N and phosphatases to acquire P) to receive thenutrients they require while substrates of poor quality are decomposed.

adaptive cycling pathways of nitrogen are close to those found previously inbacterial and archaeal phyla (Certini et al. 2004 ; Wei et al. 2015 ). As for other
terrestrial ecosystems, Antarctic terrestrial niches (Mulder et al. 1995 ; Cowan 2014 )
are occupied by bacteria. Evidence from phylogenetic gene surveys shows that themajority of primary production is regulated by bacterial taxa (Mulder et al. 1995 ).

Bacterial diversity is the product of the survival of soil work. The inherent spatial
component of endemism and clonality may have important consequences for soil
function (Godfrey and Falkowski 2009 ). Even if the change is slight and with the
unchanged mineral composition of the soil, soil texture affecting bacterial popula-tion structure presumably results in the dispersed organisation of bacteria (Hart et al.1994 ). A variety of physicochemical properties of the soil matrix, including pore
size, particle size, and water and carbon abundance, are affected by bacterialdiversity and population composition (Carson et al. 2009 ). The overall bacterial
diversity at low pore connectivity is possibly mediated by multiple interactingfactors that favour coexistence and minimise competitive interactions (Carson

these species are not essential for nitrogen cycling functional processes. For starters,
fungi have been shown to possess nitri ﬁcation pathway genes in Miers Valley soils
(Wei et al. 2015 ). Many fungi, including yeasts usually ﬁnd on Antarctic environ-

important role in the mineralisation or ammunition of nitrogen, such likeRhodotorula muscorum, the Rhodotorula mucilaginosa, the Cryptococcus aerius,and the Cryptococcus albidus (Buzzini et al. 2012 ). Many compounds of nitrogen

ﬁcation is commonly regarded as a prokaryotic process, fungal denitri ﬁers have been

role of viruses in metabolic regulation has been indicated by research in other

that a lysogenic rather than lytic phage lifestyle can be promoted by extremeenvironmental conditions, and the Antarctic “metaviromic ”experiments are circum-

2; (Fraser et al. 2009 ). Calcium
carbide, which resists nitri ﬁers at very low partial pressures, reacts with water to
form acetylene (C 2H2), approx. Oh. 10 Pa. CaC 2is exposed to soil moisture as the
parafﬁn wears off, and nitri ﬁcation is inhibited by the C 2H2produced. Similarly,
neem oil derived from the Indian neem tree (Azadirachta indica) was commerciallyused to coat pellets of urea fertiliser to slow its nitri ﬁcation to NO

"3.5.2 Denitri ﬁcation
Nitrate reductase, to end the cycle and to return the N 2to the atmosphere, it is
responsible for the reduction of nitrate to nitrite encoded by the narGHJI operon(Schimel and Bennett 2004 ). In the second step, the reduction of nitrite to nitric
oxide is catalysed by two forms of nitrite reductase: the nirS-encoded cytochromecd1 or the nirK-encoded Cu-containing enzyme (Silver et al. 2001 ; Smith and Smith
1990 ). Nitric oxide is subsequently made up to reduce by the norB-encoded nitrite
oxide reductase that generates nitrous oxide, a potent greenhouse gas with important
global warming consequences. Finally, by nitrous oxide reductase encoded by nosZ
(Stephan et al. 2000 ), nitrous oxide is reduced to N
2.

for plant uptake to be reduced. N losses due to denitri ﬁcation can interact with or
surpass losses due to nitrate laughing in regions with heavy precipitation. In general,denitri ﬁcators are better managing indirectly by controlling water levels (e.g., in rice

3.8 Soil Biota Ecology and Its Function
Ecology is the study of connexions between animals and the ambience of their
relationships. The name of the Greek term oikos, the family household, represents
the opinion of Haeckel in 1866 as a household, the climate, and species. (Kaviya
et al. 2019 ). Initially, ecology was developed to provide the study of natural history
with a mechanistic backbone. The ecology ﬁeld is associated with evolution because
of this origin, and it is believed that one of the long evolutionary histories is the
cornerstone of ecological relationships. Human ecosystem disruptions may lead to
encounters between species, which are not dependent on evolutionary history and
provide possibilities for testing this presupposition.

Since the ﬁeld of ecology is concerned with the concept of habits of species, the

of studies exploring soil microbes within the meaning of ecological science. This
interest has helped to develop microbial ecology and soil ecology areas that provide
an ecological concept of soil biota. This emphasis maintains ecologists ’essential
aims of understanding the processes that decide the spread of organisms and the

A population is a group of all organisms withassociation capacity that belong to a single genus. This renders a population ’s spatial
scale dependent on the species ’mobility. Only part of a true population
(e.g. migrating species) or multiple isolated populations (e.g. soil bacteria) may be

When certain species expand and reproduce, resources are consumed and access to
those with the same needs reduced. This reduction of one organism ’se fﬁciency by
another that requires the same capital is known as rivalry. The logistical growthequation is a statistical model that explains the intraspeci ﬁc competition ’s over-time
impact on demographic change. The likelihood of a reproduction less the chance ofdeath per unit time is proportional to the general population rise or decline over thattime. Classi ﬁcation of organisms as r- or K-selected is common in soil microbiology.3 Ecological Perspectives on Soil Microbial Community Involved in Nitrogen ... 75",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,82

grow continuously in the atmosphere on resistant organic matter.

time and space scales at an average rate. The proportion of the landscape in the
Community Matrix should be equal to the stable value de ﬁned by the rate and spatial
size of the events of destruction and the rate of return of the community matrix bysuccession.
3.9 Ecosystem Role Effects of the Microbial Population
Organisation
Soil microbes include species ranging from strict aerobics and anaerobes, high water
demand and low water need, basic inorganic, and complex organic substrates andautotrophe to heterotrophic lifestyles. Soil microbes include species. Many aspects

Despite the very short time human beings have been on the earth,ecological equilibrium has been altered by cropping and burning and, most recently,by the rise in soil chemical loads and the introduction in pesticides and other humanpesticides. Ecosystems are spatially characterised as interconnected structures by theassociation of organisms and their relationship to the physical space. For example,after the last glacial retreats, trees are still migrating, forcing new interactionsbetween the components of ecosystems. These impacts are not yet modelled by

The work of the microbial communitymodiﬁes soil chemistry through processes that improve nutrient supply or decom-
position rates. An understanding of soil biology and biochemistry is essential to
understand the impacts of land use and climate change, says Singh and Treseder. A
wide-ranging number of species have resulted, they claim, from the vast variety oforganic compounds that can be found on the earth ’s surface. The results are also
backed by metagenomic methods to determine the variability of the metabolic genes.80 S. Shukla et al.",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,87

and land use on ecosystems is essential for a balanced approach to land use changeand sustainability.
3.9.1 Energy Flow
The energy supply is the light for most structures and green plants are the autotrophs.The available energy is equal to the energy from solar power captured by photosyn-thesis in a given environment. Complete energy use by plants in an environmentusable for other trophic stages is the net primary productivity (NPP). The leaf areaand the contents N, season duration, temperature, lights, and carbon dioxide are
regulated by NPP. Most of the true decomposers are heterotrophic osmotrophic.
They release enzymes to breakdown materials and absorb pieces that increase inNPP. For mandated symbionts, the number of trees that require mycorrhizal fungusfor production and survival will be decreased and the turnover of the nutrient andecosystem characteristic will continue to be affected.",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,88
"3.9.2 Nutrient Cycles
Biotic and abiotic components provide molecules for the growth and reproduction ofliving organisms. The massive CO
2ﬂux to the atmosphere has signi ﬁcantly affected
the global C cycle. Potential human-induced shifts in the C cycle of global ﬂuxes are
the most critical ecological experiment of all time. Human response would bedictated by biological reactions to high CO

them to survive in anaerobic conditions. As such they play a singular part in

Low levels of any critical nutrient will contribute to stress and lower productivity

most environments are the ones retrieved by microbial activity through recycling.Microbes alone can return up to 100% of the nutrients needed for the growth ofplants in the decomposition of vegetable litter. Many systems may rely entirely on
local nutrient cycle components, and many systems depend on internal cycles.

layers of sophistication is the soil structure. This interacts with biodiversity or in thiscase directly with the population system of decomposition in order to determinedecomposition rates. Intellectually, the conservation of the biodiversity is necessary
for the protection of the system integrity, but the entire biodiversity of a system,
according to the authors, is dif ﬁcult to quantify. These concerns need urgent
attention in an age of diminishing global biodiversity and genetic diversity, theyadd. The notion that forests are more than trees translates the value of the term, butthey write that they can be widely generalised to any ecosystem.

3.10 Evaluation of Soil Fertility by Assessing
Microbiological Activity
Various approaches have been developed by researchers around the world to assess
soil fertility based on its microbiological behaviour.
1. General soil fertility test mechanisms require the addition of damp soil samples
with water holding potential of 60 –70% and a particular nutrient solution,
followed by incubation at 20 –30 C for 7 –30 days, and biologically-modi ﬁed
adjustments.
2. In order to determine soil fertility, the biochemical reactions requiring a nitrogen
compound metabolism are analysed.

cation, nitri ﬁcation, denitri ﬁcation, and nitri ﬁcation, are used.",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,90

3.11 Ecological Consequences of Human Modi ﬁcations
to the Cycle of Nitrogen
Most human actions have a signi ﬁcant effect on the nitrogen cycle. Burning fossil
fuels, the use of nitrogen-based fertilisers and other practises will signi ﬁcantly raise
the amount of naturally accessible nitrogen in the environment. And, since thesupply of nitrogen also restricts the primary productivity in certain species,3 Ecological Perspectives on Soil Microbial Community Involved in Nitrogen ... 83",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,90
"important changes in nitrogen supply in both marine and terrestrial ecosystems can
contribute to dramatic changes in the nitrogen cycle. Industrial nitrogen ﬁxation has
grown exponentially since the 1940s, twice the extent of global nitrogen ﬁxation by
human operation.
The inclusion of nitrogen in terrestrial ecosystems would help to mitigate forest
nutrient imbalances, enhance forest quality and biodiversity. In an improved nitro-gen supply, carbon storage often takes place and requires more processes than thenitrogen cycle. In agriculture, fertilisers are commonly used to increase the quality ofplants, but unused nitrogen can usually leak out of the soil, in ﬁltrate streams and
rivers and ultimately make its way into our drinking water. In recent decades N

signiﬁcantly improved its production method for synthetic fertilisers used in agri-
culture by allowing N 2to react to H 2, called the Haber Bosch mechanism. Probably,",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,91
"2has
signiﬁcantly improved its production method for synthetic fertilisers used in agri-
culture by allowing N 2to react to H 2, called the Haber Bosch mechanism. Probably,
almost 80% of the nitrogen in human tissues today comes from the Haber –Bosch
process (Howard-Williams and Hawes 2007 ).
In rural and urban areas, most of the nitrogen used gradually drains into rivers and
marine waters. Nitrogen development also contributes to anoxia (no oxygen) orhypoxia (low oxygen), altered biodiversity, changes in food web structure and ageneral lack of habitat in nearshore marine ecosystems. A rise in dangerous algalblooms is a typical effect of increased nitrogen (Howard-Williams and Hawes 2007 ).

"In certain countries, high deaths of ﬁsh and shell ﬁsh have been linked by toxic
blooms of certain forms of dino ﬂagellates. Even without those economically disas-
trous consequences, the addition of nitrogen will contribute to improvements inecology and species distribution that may contribute to changes in the overallfunctioning of the ecosystem. Some have also indicated that changes to the nitrogencycle can lead to an increase in risk of human and wildlife parasites and infectiousdiseases (Jobba ’gy and Jackson 2000 ). In addition, increases in nitrogen in aquatic
systems may lead to increased acidi ﬁcation.
3.12 Nitrogen Derivatives and Future Environmental
Effects

"ﬁxation crops can be induced by soil. More Nitrogen (soil) inputs have helped to
generate much more food, which is considered the “green revolution ”and feeds
more people. Nitrogen, however, will spill from the soil into the waterway, exceed-ing demand from plants. Nitrogen enrichment enables eutrophic therapy. Duringnitriﬁcation and denitri ﬁcation, another problem may arise. Nitrous oxide (N
2O)
may be generated if the chemical process is not completed. The balance of nitrogen
compounds in the environment supports plant life and is not a danger to wildlife.
N2O is a signi ﬁcant greenhouse gas —contributing to global warming. The only
explanation why problems arise being that the loop is not controlled.84 S. Shukla et al.",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,91

Soil microbiology is a multidisciplinary area of study that examines soil microbes
and their interactions. The soil has always focused on studying its physicochemicaland biological properties, as a natural habitat for survival and growth of microor-ganisms.

B. P. Bhaskar, V. Ramamurthy, and Sunil Maske
Abstract The study of soil organic carbon and total nitrogen in relation to texture,
landforms, and soil pH in riverine rice growing wetlands is very important for both
agrarian economy and land use related issues in Majuli island of Upper Brahmaputra
valley, Assam. Thus, thirteen soil series classi ﬁed under the subgroups of Inceptisols
and Entisols under different alluvial landforms in Majuli river island were selected to
investigate the distribution of organic carbon (OC) and Total nitrogen (Total N) in
pedological point of view. Our results showed an enrichment in OC and Total N on
super ﬁcial Ap horizons (silt loam to silty clay loam) to the detriment of the deep
sandy C horizons. Nevertheless, the irregular distribution of OC and total N contents",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,99

sandy C horizons. Nevertheless, the irregular distribution of OC and total N contents
with depth in strati ﬁed soils of the Island showed differential rates of leaching and its
subsequent accumulations due to depositional episodes during seasonal ﬂoods in the
region. These soils are slightly acid to neutral with mean densities of 30.49 Mg/ha of
OC in Majuli series (P5) to 196.78 Mg/ha in Dakshinpat series (P7) with signi ﬁcant
variations between the horizons ( F¼5.904). The data further shows that silty clay

6.26/C62.81 Mg/ha for sand texture whereas total N stocks were high for sand
(mean 4.71 /C63.45 Mg/ha). The strati ﬁcation of Total N and its stocks are highly

"4.1 Introduction
The agricultural ecosystems are designed mostly to produce food and other valuable
products such as ﬁber and fuel to the environment (Costanza et al. 1997 ; Millennium
Ecosystem Assessment (MEA) 2005 ; de Groot et al. 2012 ). The ecosystem services
(ES) from arable lands are largely depended on the inputs used for cultivation andthe crop management practices (Wossink and Swinton 2007 ; Ma et al. 2012 ). In
India, rice is cultivated in 43.4 million hectares (GOI 2016 ) and is widely grown in
eastern parts of India with consumption of 32% fertilizer (FAO 2005 ), 22% of
pesticide (Krishna et al. 2003 ), and about 60% of water (Raju et al. 2005 ). Rice-
based systems lead to soil loss, nutrient depletion, the hosting of pests and diseases,
and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (Barrios 2007 ; Stallman 2011 ).
In this chapter, we present current knowledge on the soil nitrogen, in rice",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,100
"and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (Barrios 2007 ; Stallman 2011 ).
In this chapter, we present current knowledge on the soil nitrogen, in rice
ecosystems due to low productivity per unit of land and often pay compensation inthe form of subsidies to the farmers and policy agendas of local government (Dahaland Bajracharya 2013 ). Soil nitrogen (N) stocks, soil pH, and carbon-nitrogen ratio
(C/N ratio) are important indicators of carbon sequestration potentials and also soilmicrobial structure and activities (Rousk et al. 2010 ). The soil carbon and nitrogen
data sets are important in attaining target yields and to conserve SOC in rice
ecosystems. Generally, the vertical patterns of SOC (soil organic carbon) in relationto total nitrogen, other physico chemical properties were examined to assess theresponse of the ecosystems to global change (Mi et al. 2008 ). Most of the soil
nitrogen studies in rice ecosystems (Nayak et al. 2019 ) primarily focused on the top",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,100
"nitrogen studies in rice ecosystems (Nayak et al. 2019 ) primarily focused on the top
soil but poorly understood nitrogen dynamics in deeper soil layers (Liu and Greaver2010 ). It is therefore needed to assess the carbon and nitrogen status in the unique
rice ecosystem of riverine ﬂoodplain wetlands of Majuli island. The vertical distri-
bution of soil organic carbon and nitrogen information in relation to soil pedological
properties of rice are scanty and are useful for understanding the pedogenic behaviorof the paddy soils for increasing crop productivity (Singaravel et al. 1996 ;
Vijayakumar et al. 2013 ). The major challenge to enhance the productivity of rice
and rice-based systems requires better crop management and crop care techniques(Barah and Pandey 2005 ). The soil resource data base generated in riverine wetlands",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,100
"and rice-based systems requires better crop management and crop care techniques(Barah and Pandey 2005 ). The soil resource data base generated in riverine wetlands
of Majuli island was chosen for pedological assessment of the vertical distribution ofSOC and nitrogen across different soil depths in alluvial landforms and worked out
its relation with texture and chemical properties.

4.2.1 Study Area
The Majuli island (93/C14300–94/C14350E and 26/C14500–27/C14100N) is located in the north of
Jorhat district in Assam state of India. The elevation varies from 60 to 85 meters94 B. P. Bhaskar et al.",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,100
"above mean sea level. The island is bounded by Kherkutia Suti, Subansiri, and
Brahmaputra rivers. The island is marked by 70 bils(local name for small ponds and
oxbow lakes). The climate is subtropical with warm humid summer and cool dry
winter with mean annual rainfall of 1900 mm. Barthakur ( 2004 )d eﬁned the climate
of island as humid mesothermal gangetic type (CWg) in accordance with Kopper. Itis further reported that south west monsoon contributes 62 –65% of annual rainfall
during April through October (Bhaskar et al. 2010 ) The island has maximum
temperature of 23.6 –31.7
/C14C and minimum temperature of 10/C14C but drops to as
low as 6.0/C14C in some years. On an average, the relative humidity is more than 80%

1:2.5 soil:water ratio. The quantity of organic carbon in the soil was estimated byusing Walkey Black method (Walkley and Black 1934 ; Jackson 1973 ). The
exchangeable K and Na were determined by ﬂame photometer while Ca and Mg
were determined using atomic absorption spectrometer. The cation exchange capac-ity (CEC) was determined by distillation method as described by Jackson ( 1979 ).
Soil bulk density was determined using the soil core sampler having a diameter of5.7 cm (Blake and Harte 1986 ). Total nitrogen (TN) was determined by the Kjeldahl
digestion-distillation method (Bremner and Mulvaney 1982 ).

"Puranibari soils (P3) but a perceptible increase of carbon below 50 cm in Boritika
(P1) and Adielengi (P3). The high content of organic carbon in A horizons of ricesoils in Majuli is ascribed to application of manure in top layer, its slow translocationprocess and lack of incorporation into the deeper layer (Anshori et al. 2020 ). The
variable distribution of total nitrogen in the soil pro ﬁles of paddy soils is in the
similar pattern of organic carbon. The strati ﬁcation of Total N shows an increase of
its content below 1 m depth indicating leaching of residual nitrogen and its subse-quent accumulation in deeper layers (Zhao et al. 2015 ). The regression equations

4.4 Pedogenic Assessment of SOC, TN, and C/N in Paddy
Soils
The dominant pedogenic process was “gleyzation ”with mottle formation (P1, P2,
P4, P8, P9, P11, P12, & P13). These soils have horizon sequence of gleyed plowedlayer (Apg) and gley cambic horizon (Bwg*, in P1, P4, P5, P6, P7, P8, P9, P12, &
P13). These soils are “saturated and ﬂooded ”resulted in characteristic morphologies
with strati ﬁed layers starting with in 15 cm of soil surface (Bharaki series, P4 with
value 3 and chroma of 1 and ochric horizon was depleted in all soil pro ﬁles with

distribution of silt and clay is irregular with depth in all the pedons. The silt content

The downward increase of clay was recorded in cambic Bw horizons of Adielengi
(P1), Chilkala (P6), and Dakshinapat series (P7). Similar kind of observations werereported in paddy soils of Thailand (Kyuma and Kawaguchi 1977 ) and in poorly
drained soils of Ohio (Smeck et al. 1981 ). The Chilkala (P6) and Dakshinpat
(P7) soils have strongly acid Ap horizons but moderately acid to neutral subsoilsin Garumara (P9), Gayangaon (P10), and Kamalabari (P8). The mean organic carbonin Ap horizons is 12.66 g/kg with coef ﬁcient of variation of 113.5 per cent but

Most of the rice soils classi ﬁed under subgroups of inceptisols and Entisols are
rich in silt and sand with clay content less than 25% and moderate CEC less than
25 cmol/kg. The Majuli island has a complex mosaic of soils belonging to subgroups
of“Inceptisols and Entisols ”with young and intermediate pedogenetic development

inﬂuenced by the uprising of Brahmaputra valley (Sarma and Phukan 2004 ), thus
having much younger geological ages. The very low nutrient content of these soils,often associated with high groundwater levels, results in the formation of thick rootmats in the soil surface (Herrera et al. 1978 ) which then strongly in ﬂuences the
amount and vertical distribution of their SOC stocks. The soil mats close to surface
layers in bil environs may reasonably be expected to exert a strong in ﬂuence on soil
SOC concentrations, in seasonally waterlogged soils (Dakshin part series, P7,AdiElengi-P3). It is therefore not a surprise that we observed some of the highestcarbon in this soil.

incorporation into the deeper layer lowered its concentration in the deeper layer

has a signi ﬁcant positive relation with CEC ( R

and also with clay ( R2¼0.352* signi ﬁcant at 5% level). The results are in agreement
with the ﬁndings of Hassink ( 1994 ) who reported that TOC contents were positively
correlated with clay and silt contents and also help to stabilize soil organic matter(Baldock and Skjemstad 2000 ; Quesada et al. 2020 ).

4.5 Conclusion
The wet land rice growing soil data base for Majuli island on was made with thirteen
soil series and twenty ﬁve soil mapping units designated as soil series association.
This soil data base was used to workout the stocks of organic cabon (OC) and total N(TN) for each soil subgroup. These soils are endosaturated throughout the year withcontinuous rice cultivation and eight textural groups were identi ﬁed. The study

"showed the strong in ﬂuence of textural class on stocks of OC and TN but not soil

suggests that rice management factors practices would be a major factor in ﬂuencing
the degree of soil organic matter and total N storage. The pro ﬁle distribution of C and
N stocks showed irregular depth trends indicating periodic depositional episodesoccurred in the Island. Our study using remote sensing and GIS techniques allows toput reasonable hurdles on soil organic and total N stocks for Majuli region (1.2 lakhhectares) with a suitable baseline data base for further studies of pedogenic changesin rice ecosystems. Understanding regional characteristics of SOC and Total N are of
great importance for designing best management practices for rice. The study

Abstract Rhizosphere, a zone of intense microbial activity is a hub of soil –plant–
microbial interactions playing a vital role in the growth and yield of plants. Physical,
chemical, and biological properties of rhizosphere are greatly in ﬂuenced by root
exudates, energy source for proliferation, and activity of microbes. Various micro-
organisms in rhizosphere greatly in ﬂuence nutrient availability and play an impor-
tant role in all aspects of nitrogen cycling. Nitrogen is one of the essential
macronutrient elements considered critical in limiting plant growth and develop-
ment. Majority of plant nitrogen uptake is accounted by organic nitrogen pool of

N fertilizers has increased by a factor of 20 since green revolution (Glass 2003 ).
Excess N from fertilizer poses a serious threat to environment by air and waterpollution by processes like denitri ﬁcation and nitrate leaching. It is high time to
increase the ef ﬁciency of plant N acquisition and reduce dependency on N fertilizers.

5.2 Rhizosphere
It was a German agronomist and plant physiologist named Lorentz Hiltner in 1904 toﬁrst use the term rhizosphere to describe the zone of intense bacterial activity in the
soil surrounding legume roots (from Greek “rhiza”means root and “sphere ”means
ﬁeld of in ﬂuence). Rhizosphere is a soil microzone under the in ﬂuence of plant roots
and is different from the remaining soil volume consequent to the exudation of
organic and inorganic substances, nutrient and water uptake, and proliferation ofmicroorganisms on the root surface. This soil –plant interface is known to be the most
dynamic environment in soil as it is a hub of soil –plant–microbe interactions as well",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,118
"dynamic environment in soil as it is a hub of soil –plant–microbe interactions as well
as an exchange site for water and nutrients, thereby playing a vital role in growth andyield of plants. There are distinct regions recognized within the rhizosphere. Theendorhizosphere includes the area within the tissues of the plant root, i.e. root
epidermis cortex zone colonized by microbes, the ectorhizosphere ; the soil colo-
nized by microbes adjacent to the root and the rhizoplane is the root surface where
endorhizosphere and ectorhizosphere merge (Lynch 1987 ). The mycorrhizosphere is
an additional component of ectorhizosphere that exists in plants colonized bymycorrhizal fungi and known to extend for a considerable distance from the root.Research on rhizosphere shows that no clearly de ﬁned zone can be demarcated for",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,118
"rhizosphere as its extent varies with the plant type, growth stage, root development,soil properties, and nutrient development, it is widely accepted that it covers at least2 mm from the rhizoplane (Liu 1997 ). With the advancement of experimental
techniques studies on rhizosphere soil are carried out by using several microcosm
called rhizo-boxes or rhizobox set-up known to be very sophisticated and use propermicrosensors for measurement of pH, redox potential, and soil moisture (Wenzelet al. 2001 ).114 P. S. Philip et al.",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,118

Root activity primarily governs the properties of the rhizosphere environment by
release of organic and inorganic substances, nutrient and water uptake, and prolif-eration of microorganisms, thereby making it different from rest of soil in all aspects.Plant roots allocate nearly 20% to 40% of photosynthetically ﬁxed carbon into the
rhizosphere (Badri and Vivanco 2009 ; Jones et al. 2009 ). Distribution of net carbon
ﬁxed by plant to belowground region was also studied by Uren ( 2007 ) and it is

"growth and activity. The physical and chemical composition of rhizodeposition
varies with plant species and their developmental stages.
It is a well-known fact that microbes play a key role in nutrient recycling. Plants,
by means of exudation of several biomolecules by their actively growing roots have
the ability to modify the pool of microbial diversity in the rhizosphere. Physical,chemical, and biological properties of rhizosphere are determined by various rootexudates, their nature and amount. A wide range of such organic substances releasedinto the rhizosphere potentially determines the diversity of microbial communitiesinhabiting the root surface.

by Nannipieri et al. ( 2003 ) reported that life of microbes in soil is restricted to a
minor volume being localized in hot spots such as the rhizosphere soil with acontinuous access to low and high molecular weight organic substrates derivedfrom roots. Gray and Williams ( 1971 ) studied in ﬂuence of rhizosphere of wheat

rhizosphere soil differs from bulk soil in other properties too. Marschner ( 1995 )
reported that rhizosphere pH is observed lower that of bulk soil by 1 –2 units,
attributed to several mechanisms like production of CO 2by respiration processes,
extrusion of H+during nutrient uptake by plant and microbes, exudation of organic
acids by roots and microbes, organic matter decomposition, and N 2ﬁxation by
Rhizobium -legume symbiosis.

demand of oxygen required for respiration of carbonaceous compounds gettingreleased from time to time. Redox potential is also found much more negative inrhizosphere in comparison to bulk soil owing to higher oxygen consumption by

High population of denitri ﬁers (anaerobic bacteria) (Table 5.1) in the soil –plant
interface facilitates reduction of nitrogen. Nitrogenase enzyme for N ﬁxation is also
known to be sensitive to aerobic conditions; rhizosphere with limited oxygen supplyprovides the best platform N

is known to be more aerobic than bulk soil (Vega 2007 ). Evidences from several
studies showed that higher diversity of functional genes such as amoA and nifH

5.3 Nitrogen
Nitrogen exists in nature dominantly as N 2gas contributing up to 78% of the earth ’s
atmosphere. Nitrogen is a structural component in plant cell components and isdirectly involved in processes like plant photosynthesis, protein synthesis signifyingits importance as primary nutrient in plant growth. It is a key constituent of aminoacids, nucleic acids, nucleotides, proteins, chlorophyll, ribosomes, chromosomes,genes, and a component of all enzymes. Since it is a constituent of chlorophyll,nitrogen is responsible for dark-green color to plants and it helps in the vegetativegrowth of crop plants (Karthika et al. 2018 ).

Plant roots possess a mucilage layer at the soil –root interface. This consists of
several organic and inorganic nutrients, including proteins, polypeptides, and aminoacids that contain N. The mucilaginous layer also acts as a home for many soil
microbes. Root surface too is inhabited by many microorganisms. Many genera of
bacteria aid in non-symbiotic N ﬁxation at the root surface which results in an
increased number of microorganisms in the rhizosphere soil than the bulk soil (Liu1997 ).

as inert form of atmospheric molecular nitrogen and biologically reactive form ofnitrogen, viz. NO",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,122
"The most critical macronutrient element, N is distributed on earth in two large pools:
as inert form of atmospheric molecular nitrogen and biologically reactive form ofnitrogen, viz. NO
3,N H 4, and organic nitrogen. These two large pools are
interconnected and controlled by microbially mediated processes, nitrogen ﬁxation,
and denitri ﬁcation (Gruber and Galloway 2008 ). Losses of mineral N from terrestrial
ecosystem are mainly through microbially mediated processes nitri ﬁcation and
denitri ﬁcation. Dissimilatory nitrate reduction (DNRA) is a process mediated by
bacteria and fungi wherein respiratory reduction of nitrate to more stable ammoniumform takes place, thereby limiting losses of N from soil system. DNRA is morefavored in the rhizosphere due to higher C near the roots and it is also reported thatbacteria possessing key gene involved in DNRA is overrepresented in rhizospherethan bulk soil (Li et al. 2014 ). N cycle begins with this inert dinitrogen (N
2) form and",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,122
"2) form and
follows it through the process of ﬁxation, mineralization, immobilization, nitri ﬁca-
tion, ammonia volatilization, leaching, runoff, plant assimilation and completes with
denitri ﬁcation. Microorganisms are involved in all major aspects of the cycle. Plant
available N in soil depends on the balance between rates of mineralization, nitri ﬁ-
cation, and denitri ﬁcation.
Rhizosphere plays a very important role in soil N cycle and the processes related
to it (Wen et al. 2019 ). Nitrogen in rhizosphere gains huge importance due to the
major form of N available in rhizosphere soil, i.e. organic forms of N that actuallycontribute to plant uptake (Liu 1997 ). Plant N uptake takes place as a result of
several transformations to convert the organic forms of N to inorganic forms. As
plants cannot take up N in its atmospheric form, it needs to be transformed to eitheras nitrate (NO
3/C0) or ammoniacal (NH 4+) to facilitate its uptake by plants (Karthika",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,122
"plants cannot take up N in its atmospheric form, it needs to be transformed to eitheras nitrate (NO
3/C0) or ammoniacal (NH 4+) to facilitate its uptake by plants (Karthika
et al. 2018 ). Atmospheric N is converted to these forms by N ﬁxation by soil
microorganisms. This could be by either symbiotic or non-symbiotic N ﬁxations
which are microbial mediated processes. Once the N is incorporated as amino acids118 P. S. Philip et al.",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,122
"or proteins into the plant body, it undergoes recycling processes several times
through the activities of decomposers (Jhonson 2009 ). The entire process of ﬁxing
of atmospheric N 2into rhizosphere and/or plant compartment, transformation from
one form of nitrogen into the other, scavenging of organic N by microbial action and
reabasorption by plants altogether comprises the “nitrogen cycle ”.
5.3.2.1 Nitrogen Fixation in Rhizosphere
Nitrogen plays a major role in enhancing the agricultural production and since it is a
constituent of proteins and amino acids, it adds to the food value. In soil, nitrogen ispresent in both organic and inorganic forms. However, the bulk of the soil nitrogen isin organic form ~90 to 95 percent. Nitrogen ﬁxation can be considered as one of the

bution is lesser than legume N ﬁxation. Scienti ﬁc literatures disclose that the

Biological N Fixation
Effective nutrient management requires effective management of biological N
ﬁxation. Biological N ﬁxation includes the processes through which atmospheric
N is converted to ammonia with the involvement of nitrogenase enzyme (Smercinaet al. 2019 ). It depends on biological activity as it is carried out by microorganisms
present in soil. The availability of N in terrestrial ecosystems is mainly governed by
the processes of biological N ﬁxation (Vitousek et al. 2002 ). Biological N ﬁxation
can be symbiotic N ﬁxation, non-symbiotic or associative, and free living N ﬁxation.
These are carried out by symbiotic N ﬁxers, associative N ﬁxers as well as free living
Nﬁxers. Free living N ﬁxation is mainly a microbially driven process when

Symbiotic N Fixation
Symbiotic N ﬁxation is the well-known example for symbiotic association that exists
between roots of leguminous crops and N ﬁxing bacteria. This results from the
complex interaction between the host plant and rhizobia (a term used collectively toRhizobium ,Bradyrhizobium ,Sinorhizobium , and Mesorhizobium ) (Sulieman and
Tran 2014 ).Rhizobium andBradyrhizobium , mainly belonging to αproteobacteria,
are the main N ﬁxers that inhabit the root nodules of leguminous crops. These
usually occur as free living bacteria and are found in plenty in the rhizosphere oflegumes. However, a very small number of βproteobacteria are also found as
tropical legume symbionts (Fenchel et al. 2012 ). In case of rhizobium –legume

There are several other symbiotic systems but less important than legume –

has a symbiotic association with Azolla . This symbiosis enhances N ﬁxation in rice

Free living N ﬁxers contribute only a small fraction of plant rhizosphere ecosys-

symbiotic relationship. Several studies ﬁnd FLNF as a subcategory of symbiotic N
ﬁxation. However, FLNF was described as an entirely different process carried out
by wholly different bacterial species by Smercina et al. 2019 . The process is

"5.3.2.2 N Mineralization
As discussed in previous sections of this chapter, majority share of N in the
rhizosphere and soil in general is present as complex organic molecules whichneed to be converted to plant usable forms by microorganisms present at the soil –
root interface. Mineralization of organic nitrogen is a three step process, namely
aminization, ammoni ﬁcation, and nitri ﬁcation. The pace of these processes is
affected by carbon:nitrogen (C:N) ratio of the organic substrate present. In case offresh and easily decomposable organic material with a narrower C:N ratio, miner-alization takes place faster whereas for high molecular weight compounds like ligninand humus with a wider C:N ratio mineralization is very slow. Release of photo-synthates by plant roots is thought to trigger rhizosphere priming, that is, theacceleration of microbial soil organic matter (SOM) decomposition by increased

Heterotrophic bacteria, actinomycetes, and fungi are capable of doing by enzymatic
digestion of proteins and other proteinous compounds released from roots or fromorganic residues in the rhizosphere to amino acids and amines and the process isknown as aminization.

high diversity amoA in the rhizosphere favor the process of ammoni ﬁcation in this
narrow zone.
Nitriﬁcation
Nitriﬁcation is a two step oxidation process wherein oxidation of ammonium ion
(NH 4+) is carried out to nitrate ion (NO 3/C0) by nitrifying organisms. In the ﬁrst step,
NH 4+is converted to nitrite (NO 2/C0)b yNitrosomonas, Micrococcus, Nitrospira, and
Nitrogela and then conversion of NO 2/C0to NO 3/C0is mediated by the Nitrobacter and
Nitrocystis . Nitri ﬁcation is negatively in ﬂuenced by low soil pH, anaerobic condi-
tions, lack of soil water, and temperatures below 5/C14C and above 40/C14C.

5.3.2.3 Immobilization
Soil microorganisms utilize inorganic N forms for building up their body tissues,
thereby leading to temporary unavailability of nitrogen for plant uptake. Thisprocess of conversion of inorganic nitrogen into organic forms is termed as immo-bilization. It is a reversal of mineralization process. Main factor governing immobi-lization process is the C:N ratio of the substrate available for rhizosphere dwellers.More complex the organic substrate, wider will be the C:N ratio leading to a higherN demand by saprophytes feeding on this. To meet their elevated N demand,decomposers utilize either added or native N source immediately available to
them. The process of immobilization leads only to short term unavailability of N
for plants.

These microorganisms use organic compounds as their energy source which is
available in plenty in the rhizosphere and higher population of denitrifying bacteria
are present at soil –root interface than in bulk soil. Favorable conditions for denitri-
ﬁcation process include limited O 2supply, high concentration of NO 3/C0, soil mois-
ture presence, carbohydrates source, and warm temperatures (Luo et al. 2000 ; Strong
and Fillery 2002 ). Nitrate and nitrite act as electron acceptors instead of O 2for
respiration by microorganisms in denitri ﬁcation.

5.3.3 Nitrogen Cycling in Rice
Rice is an important food crop of the majority of the population around the world and
deserves special attention because of its cultivation practices. Though upland ricealso shares considerable area, wetland rice occupies the major share. The chemistryof wetland rhizosphere is entirely different from those of upland which plays a majorrole in the crop growth by in ﬂuencing physicochemical properties of the soil and
nutrient availability. The rhizosphere of ﬂooded rice exhibits an environment more
aerobic than the bulk soil. Rice plants have got aerenquima tissue which permits thetransport of O
2to the roots and its release into the rhizosphere (Marschner 1995 ).

processes, newly recognized processes such as fungal denitri ﬁcation, anaerobic meth-
ane oxidation coupled with denitri ﬁcation, archaeal ammonia oxidation, and anaerobic
ammonium oxidation also contribute to N cycling in rice ﬁelds (Ishii et al. 2011 ).
Biological nitrogen ﬁxation can occur in the surface of rice rhizosphere by free-
living or plant-associated bacteria. As depicted in Fig. 5.1the process of nitri ﬁcation

tem, which might be due to strong denitri ﬁcation activity in rice soils. In addition,
ammonia volatilization is also mostly negligible in most rice environment until thepH of the soil is more than 8.5.

Under anaerobic condition also mineralization –immobilization reactions play sig-
niﬁcant role in the availability and consequently the plant N uptake. The conversion
of organic form of N to inorganic form (mineralization) and the reverse process(immobilization) are widely governed by plant characteristics, C:N ratio, and soilproperties. The ﬁrst step of mineralization is aminization where complex organic",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,130
"moieties are converted to amines. Later these amines are biochemically transferred toammonium by heterotrophic microorganisms. Ammonium is transferred to nitrate bythe process of nitri ﬁcation which is recognized as two step oxidation process,
wherein ammonium is ﬁrst oxidized into nitrite (NO
2), being known as ammonia
oxidation and the second step, nitrite oxidation involves the oxidation of nitrite tonitrate (NO
3). Ammonia oxidation is carried out by ammonia oxidizing bacteria
(AOB), viz. Nitrosomonas spp. and Nitrospira spp. of Betaproteobacteria and
Nitrosococcus spp. of Gammaproteobacteria. Besides bacteria, certain archaea can
also perform ammonia oxidation and are documented as ammonia oxidizing archaea

upon the soil type or land characteristics. Francis et al. ( 2007 ) depicted abundance of
AOA over AOB in ocean, whereas the case was reverse with respect to the upland
agricultural soils. The predominance of microbial community also varies in the
paddy soil environment. Bowatte et al. ( 2006 ) discussed about the difference in
microbial community in connection with the difference in fertilization.
In the next step of nitri ﬁcation i.e. nitrite oxidation, the conversion of nitrite to
nitrate is performed by nitrite oxidizing bacteria, viz. Nitrobacter, Nitrospira,
Nitrospina, Nitrococcus andNitrospira. Similar to ammonia oxidizers, community
of nitrite oxidizers may also vary depending on the nitrogen fertilization practices.Among the various species of nitrite oxidizers, Nitrospira spp. were predominant in

Environmental Perspectives of Nitri ﬁcation and Denitri ﬁcation in Rice
Rhizosphere
In rice rhizosphere under reduced condition, nitrate (NO
3/C0) is reduced to gaseous
end products such as NO, N 2O, and N 2by microbes through a process termed as
denitri ﬁcation which causes major loss of N from the paddy ﬁelds. The major end
product is reported to be N 2because of strong denitri ﬁcation activity in the rice
rhizosphere (Nakaya et al. 2009 ). Like nitri ﬁcation, denitri ﬁcation is not exclusively
carried out by microbes and can be either bio-denitri ﬁcation or chemo-denitri ﬁcation
and the latter occurs only when highly acidic soils are submerged. The seat of
nitriﬁcation is at the surface thin oxidized layer, whereas denitri ﬁcation occurs just
below the oxidized layer. Deep placement of ammoniacal fertilizers reduces the extentof denitri ﬁcation. Denitri ﬁcation is performed by a variety of microbial communities",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,131
"below the oxidized layer. Deep placement of ammoniacal fertilizers reduces the extentof denitri ﬁcation. Denitri ﬁcation is performed by a variety of microbial communities

cation gains special focus (Hayatsu et al. 2008 ) and a typical example of which is
Fusarium oxysporum carrying nirK genes responsible for nitrate reduction.
Dissimilatory nitrate reduction (DNRA) and ammonia fermentation are the two
terminologies relating to denitri ﬁcation discussed recently. DNRA implies the
dissimilatory reduction of nitrate to ammonium via nitrite which depends on carboncontent, type of carbon, and the electron acceptors (Hayatsu et al. 2008 ). In addition
to DNRA, nitrate can be reduced to ammonia by ammonia fermentation as ethanol isoxidized to acetate along with nitrate reduction and is widely being carried out byfungi (Zhou et al. 2002 ). Anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox) is another",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,131
"process wherein N
2is produced when both ammonium and nitrite are present in rice
soils. The process is of less signi ﬁcance in rice rhizosphere (Suwa et al. 2008 ).
Though occurrence of nitri ﬁcation-denitri ﬁcation reactions in rice rhizosphere
may cause loss of applied fertilizer N, it can reduce the risk of environmentalpollution by eliminating or by decreasing leaching of nitrate nitrogen and emissionof N
2O, a potential greenhouse gas. Besides less emission of N 2O, rice rhizosphere
has been occupied with a greater number of denitri ﬁers which helps in signi ﬁcant
removal of N 2O (Ishii et al. 2011 ).5 Functional Nitrogen in Rhizosphere 127",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,131
"5.3.3.2 Nitrogen Fixation in Rice Soils
Biological nitrogen ﬁxation (BNF) helps to incorporate atmospheric N to soil N,
particularly in rhizosphere soil which helps in compensating the denitri ﬁcation
losses of N. Besides cyanobacteria and phototrophic bacteria found in the surface
of rice soils can also ﬁx atmospheric N 2. Nitrogen ﬁxing microbes in the water-
logged rice ecosystem contribute around 40 –50 kg N ha/C01, which is cumulative
effect of photoautotrophs such as Rhodopseudomonas and blue green algae and
heterotrophs like Azotobacter, Beijerinckia, Clostridium, Desulfovibrio, Klebsiella,

Application of fertilizers alone without knowing the chemistry of both soil and the

Plant nutrient availability is a major constraint limitingthe crop growth and development particularly in soils low in available nutrients.Plants take up the mineral nutrients through a microzone of soil (~ 2 mm) present inthe immediate vicinity of the roots called “rhizosphere ”where soil microorganisms,
plant roots, and the nutrients interact with each other and vary with plant species andsoil types. The importance of this zone is often neglected due to lack of adequate
knowledge on its role in plant nutrition and mechanisms leading for nutrient uptake.

Nitrogen (N) one of the most important nutrients needed for the vital growth of
the plants is described as “universally de ﬁcient nutrient ”since its shortage is widely
spread and limits crop production across the world. Besides an essential element, its
role as an environmental pollutant is also widely recognized. Hence, it is important
to understand the chemistry of N transformations and uptake taking place in therhizosphere. Among the three mechanisms of nutrient uptake, viz. mass ﬂow,128 P. S. Philip et al.",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,132
"diffusion, and root interception, N is mostly carried from the soil to roots via
combination of mass ﬂow and diffusion since it is a mobile nutrient. Root intercep-
tion is thought to account for 1% of total N uptake. McMurtrie and Nasholm ( 2017 )
pointed out that root-N uptake is sensitive to the rate of mass ﬂow for widely spaced
roots with high N uptake capacity, but not for closely spaced roots or roots with lowuptake capacity. They also highlighted that nitrogen traverses the rhizosphere fasterin the presence of mass ﬂow, dropping the possibility of its immobilization before
reaching the root surface.
In general, plants take up nitrogen in the form of nitrate (NO
3/C0) and ammonium
(NH 4+) ions. Among the essential elements for plant growth, mineral N is the only
plant nutrient that is available in both as a cationic and an anionic form and plant

The uptake of NH 4+has been studied less intensively than that of NO 3/C0. Most of the
crops take up N in NO 3/C0form except rice, oat, potato, tea, etc. which preferably take
NH 4+form. Maathuis ( 2009 ) reported that plants grown in low pH and reducing
environment as in mature forests or arctic tundra preferably take up ammonium oramino acids, whereas plants acclimatized to higher pH and aerobic conditionpreferentially take up N in nitrate form. It is also clear that many species thatnormally use NO

inorganic forms in rhizosphere which has in ﬂuence on both availability and uptake

nitrogen, ammonium nitrogen (NH

Organic forms of N in soils are aminoacids, amino sugars, nucleic acids, glycerol-phosphatides, amines, vitamins, andDNA as well as more complex organic molecules like proteins.
Plants absorb nitrogen in both organic and inorganic forms (Jones et al. 2005 ;
Glass 2009 ). The most preferentially absorbed inorganic forms are nitrate and
ammonium (Courty et al. 2015 ). Certain literature depicted that N can be taken up
by the plant roots as organic forms which may vary from simpler low organic
compounds such as amino acids, oligopeptides, nucleotides, and urea to complexpolymeric moieties such as proteins (Hill et al. 2011 ). Amino acids are one of the",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,133

It was demonstrated by certain studies that amino5 Functional Nitrogen in Rhizosphere 129",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,133
"acids can be taken as the main indicator of the N status of plants, which is important
for the regulation of plant N uptake (Forde 2014 ; Gent and Forde 2017 ).
It has been proven physiologically that different transporters are responsible for
the uptake of inorganic (NO 3/C0and NH 4+) and organic N from the soil into roots.
Nitrate is absorbed by plants against an electrochemical gradient and can be consid-ered as an energy demanding (active) process and hence uptake of NO
3/C0–N is less
energetically ef ﬁcient than ammonium uptake (Wang et al. 1993 ), which may be
either active or passive, reliant upon the ammonium concentration in soils. If N istaken up by the plants as NO

3/C0–N can be viewed as an energy expensive process
as preliminary reduction of nitrate to ammonium is essential, whereas absorbedammonium can be directly assimilated in order to synthesize amino acids andother organic compounds (Moreau et al. 2019 ). Being a cation, NH
4+will bind to
the cation exchange sites of the soil and is less mobile than NO 3/C0and hence more
available for plant N uptake (Courty et al. 2015 ). Chapin et al. ( 2002 ) reviewed that

The plants will take up nitrogen in different forms and proportions which may be
inﬂuenced by many factors. Though the exact mechanisms are not well documented,
the various factors affecting nitrogen uptake in the rhizosphere can be groupedbroadly in to plant characteristics, soil factors, and biotic factors (Fig. 5.2).

(1997 ) opined that the genotypic variations with regard to N form uptake may be
linked to different transporters present in the plant species. Root architecture isanother major factor in ﬂuencing the plant N uptake. Arai-Sanoh et al. ( 2014 )
reported that deeper rooting in rice facilitates N uptake particularly from N
deﬁcient soils. Britto and Kronzucker ( 2002 ) pointed out that susceptibility to130 P. S. Philip et al.",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,134

throughout their growth, while the grasses preferred NH 4+at the early stages but
switched the preference for NO 3/C0later. A family of transporters (mainly NRT2
and NRT1) mediate root responses to NO 3/C0by modulating auxin transport (and
other plant hormones and signal molecules) so as to regulate the root systemarchitecture (Sun et al. 2017 ).

100 gM and higher, net uptake of NO 3/C0was very low, even at NO 3/C0concentrations

by various mechanism like a decrease in nitrate reductase activity (NRA) (Peuke

inhibition of NO 3inﬂux through inducible carrier system for NO 3uptake (Siddiqi

prompting the N form uptake due to its ability to alleviate ammonium toxicity innitrate specialist plants (Li et al. 2012 ).

rhizosphere. Rhizodeposition is a major source of C and N for the soil and its
inhabitants (Jensen 1996 ). Composition of root exudates may vary depending
upon the plant species and the form of N applied. Plants supplied with NH
4+tend
to exude higher concentrations of carbohydrates and amino acids than that fromroots supplied with NO
3/C0(Cramer and Titus 2001 ; Mahmood et al. 2002 ).

"3/C0(Cramer and Titus 2001 ; Mahmood et al. 2002 ).
Changes in Soil Properties as Affected by N Form Uptake
The form of N taken up by the plants signi ﬁcantly causes certain changes in the
properties of soil particularly in the rhizospheric soil and hence there is difference inthe former from the bulk soil.
Soil pH :Uptake of nitrogen as NH
4+decreases and uptake of NO 3/C0increases the
pH of rhizosphere soil not only in annual species but also in coniferous trees such asNorway spruce (Marschner et al. 1991 ). The rhizosphere and rhizoplane pH may
vary from the bulk soil pH by up to 2 units (Marschner and Romheld 1983 ). The
increase in pH of the rhizosphere soils of NO
3/C0fed plants may be caused by H+/NO 3
cotransport (1/1 or >1/1) at the plasma membrane (McClure et al. 1990 ) or may also
due to preferential reduction of NO 3in the plant roots.
Relative concentration of NO 32or NH 4+: Uptake of N either as NO 3/C0or NH 4+",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,136
"due to preferential reduction of NO 3in the plant roots.
Relative concentration of NO 32or NH 4+: Uptake of N either as NO 3/C0or NH 4+
causes a decline or increase in the concentration of NO 3/C0or NH 4+in the rhizosphere
soil from that of the bulk soil and it depends upon the plant species and relativeproportion of NO
3/C0or NH 4+in the rhizosphere soil (Marschner et al. 1991 ).
Availability of other nutrients : Uptake of N either as NO 3/C0or NH 4+affects the
availability of other nutrients primarily through modifying the soil pH. Ruan et al.(2000 ) reported that concentration of Al and Mn was greater in the rhizosphere soil
with NH
4+N nutrition. Available P content in the soil may vary depending upon the
native P content irrespective of the forms of N taken up by the plants (Ruan et al.
2000 ). Solubility and toxicity of mineral elements like aluminum and availability
and uptake of other mineral nutrients are in ﬂuenced by the shift in pH in the132 P. S. Philip et al.",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,136

et al. 1991 ).
5.3.5 Other Microbial Interactions and their Role in N
Dynamics
Plants absorb mineral nutrients from the soil solution predominantly in ionic forms
and microorganisms in the rhizosphere mediate nutrient transformation reactions tomake these into plant usable forms. There are so many interactions belowgroundbetween plant and micro ﬂora and fauna that plays a role in nutrient dynamics. It is
evidenced that arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi take up nitrate, ammonium, andorganic forms of N from the mycorrhizal interface and transfer to the plant partner inreturn to carbon supply from host plant (Govindarajulu et al. 2005 ; Fellbaum et al.
2012 ). Behie et al. ( 2012 ) reported that plants can acquire N from soil insects
through their endophytic associations with Metarhizium spp. (a ubiquitous soil-
dwelling insect –pathogenic fungi). This insect-derived N represented up to 48% of",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,137
"through their endophytic associations with Metarhizium spp. (a ubiquitous soil-
dwelling insect –pathogenic fungi). This insect-derived N represented up to 48% of
the plant N content and was driven by allocation of C from the plant roots to thefungal mycelium (Behie et al. 2017 ). In addition, there is increasing evidence that
dark septate endophytic (DSE) fungi have the potential to facilitate the transfer N toplants (Vergara et al. 2017 ).
5.3.6 Conclusion
This chapter gives evidences for the fact that plant –microbe interactions in rhizo-
sphere environment signi ﬁcantly in ﬂuence N cycle and transformation processes in
many ways. Any alterations in the properties of this microzone are governed bynature and amount of root exudates released over a period of time. Consequently, thefate of N in the soil has got a strong relation with the highly speci ﬁc plant root",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,137
"activity, as most of processes affecting nutrient management are governed by rootsand soil adhering to root surface in the rhizosphere. Comprehensive knowledge oncomplex interactions taking place in rhizosphere in relation to nutrient availabilitywould help us to understand and work on regulating the fertilizer application and
enhancing nutrient use ef ﬁciency. Future research studies focussing more on ef ﬁ-
cient and strategic use of nitrogen ﬁxing plants are highly required as biological
nitrogen ﬁxation in plants acts as a sustainable source for nitrogen would help in
reducing over dependency on industrial nitrogen production. In this context, more insitu rhizosphere studies are urgently demanded to address our lack of knowledge inrelation to N dynamics in rhizosphere as it is the plant roots which determine thenature of rhizosphere environment and associated microbiome.5 Functional Nitrogen in Rhizosphere 133",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,137

Abstract Soil biota plays a critical role in the functioning of ecosystem. In terres-
trial regions nitrogen is limiting constituent that determines the growth of plants,
primary productivity therefore net productivity of an ecosystem can be controlled by
combined activities of micro ﬂora and fauna of soil which facilitate the conversion of
nitrogen to usable forms. Varieties of microorganisms that are highly diverse in
terms of taxa and activities are engaged in N cycle including nitrogen ﬁxers,
ammonia oxidizers, autotrophic nitri ﬁers, heterotrophic nitri ﬁers, anammox bacteria,
denitri ﬁers, archaea, and fungi. In addition, soil fauna perform the signi ﬁcant role in

Nitrogen is one of the important constituents of proteins, chlorophyll, DNA, and
other biomolecules, therefore it is essential for survival of all living organismspresent in the nature but is not directly accessible for organisms. The inaccessibilityof nitrogen in dinitrogen form makes its ﬂow restrict throughout the ecosystem. By
the means of nitrogen cycle, nitrogen is converted into usable forms so that itbecomes available to living organisms this makes the understanding of this cycleof great concern.

nitrogen cycling soil (Hayatsu et al. 2008 ). Moreover, there are archaea that also
mediate nitri ﬁcation and anammox reactions. Recent studies have been carried out to
explore the role of fungi in nitrogen cycling and it has been speculated that many
types of fungi are potent contributors in producing nitrous oxide and dinitrogen in
different ecosystems such as grasslands, forest, and semiarid areas. Fungi performthe respiration of oxygen, nitrite as well as fermentation of ammonia as substrate togenerate energy for their survival in varying oxygen conditions.",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,144

in soil are depicted in Fig. 7.1.
Nitrogen cycle starts with nitrogen ﬁxation in which nitrogen present in the air is
transformed into ammonia by nitrogen ﬁxers including Azotobacter and archaea.
Some nitrogen ﬁxers exhibit symbiotic relations with higher plants while some are
free-living diazotrophs. Nitri ﬁcation is the next process of N cycling in which

the anaerobic process of converting nitrite/nitrates into dinitrogen via formingnitrous oxide (N

pathway of nitrogen cycle for releasing ﬁxed nitrogen to environment. It is also the
only process of releasing N 2O and NO from the soil ecosytem (Houlton and Bai

show symbiotic relationship with leguminous or non-leguminous plants. Non-symbiotic ﬁxation can contribute nitrogen to the soil that is de ﬁcient in nitrogen.

The archaeal adaptations in harsh environmentscan be represented by three ecological categories: thermophilic, methanogenic, andhalophilic. Archaea bacteria are ubiquitous in nature as they also thrive in freshwater
sediments, temperate soil, and other less adverse environment conditions.

be observed in different types of processes like denitri ﬁcation, codenitri ﬁcation, and

Denitri ﬁcation is a process of formation of nitrous oxide or nitrogen via reduction
of NO 3/C0/NO 2/C0respectively, by microbes. It is the process of dissimilation. In many
studies, it has been believed that this process is solely performed by prokaryotic
organisms and process of bacteria ( Paracoccus, Pseudomonas ) mediated denitri ﬁ-

observed that F. oxysporum andF. solani have nitrite reducing capabilities in low O 2
state (Bollag and Tung 1972 ). Shoun et al. ( 1992 ) found that several phyla of fungi

biochemical and physiological role of soil fungi in denitri ﬁcation was investigated
by isolating pure cultures fungi (Shoun 2006 ). Recent studies have shown that fungi
can perform reduction process in the presence of oxygen as well as in the absence ofoxygen. According to the ability of reducing NO
3/C0or NO 2/C0in dissimilatory manner
two categories of denitrifying fungi have been de ﬁned. One category of fungi
reduces both NO 3/C0or NO 2/C0into N 2O, such as Fusarium oxysporum andGibberella6 Potential Contribution of Soil Micro ﬂora and Fauna in Nitrogen Cycle: A ... 151",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,155

Fungi mediated denitri ﬁcation speci ﬁcally take place in its mitochondrial cham-
ber, later is also involved in performing respiration in anaerobic state as observed in
many bacterial cells (Kobayashi et al. 1996 ). Nitrate reductase ( Nar) involved in

that this enzyme was not identical to soluble nitrate reductase enzyme involved inassimilation process (Uchimura et al. 2002 ). This enzyme (Nar) found to be similar
to nitrate reducing enzyme involved in dissimilation process performed by otherdenitri ﬁer bacteria.
Nitrite reductase (Nir) also plays the key role in the dissimilation process. This
enzyme is divided into two types on the basis of their structure:

speciﬁc soil fungi that can boost the plant nutrient accession. In this type of
symbiosis, fungi enter into root cortical cells of tracheophytes by the means ofarbuscules (Smith and Read 2010 ). AMF are obligate symbiotic microbes due to
having restricted saprophytic activities and therefore predominantly dependent onthe host plant for their nutrition (Harley and Smith 1983 ).

1993 ; Corkidi et al. 2002 ), as well as genetic constitution of the generated crops (Liu

proliferating their hyphae, and acquire nitrogen (N) from the organic sources. These
can transfer inorganic nitrogen in the form of NO 3/C0or NH 4+to their host plants.
Nitrogren transfer mechanism mediated by fungi to their respective host was
instigated in many studies (Bago et al. 2001 ). This mechanism includes a pathway
through which nitrogen is transferred from ERM to IRM (extra-radical mycelia tointra radical mycelia) in the form of an amino acid, i.e. Arg (Arginine). This pathwayis commonly known as GOGAT pathway or glutamine synthetase (GS)/glutamatesynthase pathway. Nitrogen moves from the soil into the fungal ERM through a

found to be expressed during the assimilation as well as in metabolism.

functional enzyme as it catalyzes denitri ﬁcation and codenitri ﬁcation both in the
presence of NADH or co-substrates, correspondingly (Su et al. 2004 ). There is a

Fermentation of Ammonia
In nitrate metabolism, ammonia fermentation is another type of dissimilatory process
which has also been observed in the denitrier F. oxysporum (Takasaki et al. 2004 ;
Zhou et al. 2001 ). In this process nitrate which gets reduced to ammonia and ethanol
is simultaneously get oxidized into acetic acid to form ATP. Nitrate act as the
terminal electron acceptor for fermentation in this pathway but not for anaerobicrespiration. Ammonia fermentation needs more anoxic condition than denitri ﬁcation

anaerobic denitri ﬁcation are only the processes of nitrogen transformations. As156 M. Mishra et al.",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,160
"described in the present study, however, other novel processes are also persist in soil
ecosystem that transforms the nitrogen in other forms and are driven bacteria as wellas archaea and fungi. Although, some forms of nitrogen act as pollutants and can
adversely affect human and environmental health hence, understanding of micro ﬂora
and fauna mediated different processes involved in transformations of nitrogen isessential for understanding and managing health and productivity of ecosystem. Soilfauna also play pivot role in nitrogen cycling mainly in mineralization process,however, there is a need of exploring interactive mechanisms of soil fauna withother living organisms extensively as well as their functional diversities relative tonitrogen cycling beyond mineralization. In order to investigate diversity in micro-ﬂora, enzymes and processes speci ﬁc isolation techniques as well as molecular tools
should be developed.

Abstract The rhizosphere is a biologically active zone of the soil around plant roots
containing soil microbes including bacteria and fungi, where plant –microbe inter-
actions taking place are often bene ﬁcial to the plant, the microbes or to neither of
them. The developments in molecular biology methods of recent times are focusing
on rhizospheric microbial diversity. The rhizosphere is a microenvironment which is
very much different from non-rhizosphere soil. The activity of the microbes in the
rhizosphere is high and leads to better cycling and availability of nutrients improving
the chemical soil quality indicators. With the advances in second generation

"sequencing and omic technologies, several important mechanisms underlying
plant–microbe interactions have been revealed. Metagenomics has revolutionized
microbial ecology by facilitating the genomic characterization of microbial commu-
nities in various segments of the environment. This has provided a deep insight to the
genes that are present in varying environments and constitutes powerful reference
material for studying microbial gene expression. Another approach,
metatranscriptomics, enables the characterization of community transcription pat-
terns and is a signi ﬁcant advancement in understanding of plant and microbe gene
expression. This chapter discusses about how metatranscriptomics could rapidly
improve our understanding of plant –microbe interactions in the rhizospheric region.

"7.1 Introduction
The nitrogen cycle is an important collection of biogeochemical pathways respon-
sible for transforming atmospheric nitrogen (not usable by plants) to organic andinorganic forms which can be used by plants in different ecosystem. Microbialcommunities are responsible for mediating these pathways. The process of nitrogencycle is transforming one form of nitrogen to another with the help of differentpathways that include nitrogen ﬁxation, assimilation, ammoni ﬁcation, nitri ﬁcation
and some other oxidation-reduction reactions. Different microbes are responsible forproviding plants with different sources of nitrogen (Cropnutrition.com).

"Nitrogen is the most essential macronutrient required by plants to survive because
it is an essential component of nucleotide and protein and because it is a majorcomponent of chlorophyll. Without proteins, plants would wither out and die, andwithout chlorophyll, they would not be able to carry out photosynthesis. Nitrogen isalso a compound of ATP (which is used for energy driven reactions), forms certainenzymes in plants and is also a component of DNA (stores genetic information).Without nitrogen there will be no plant life. Nitrogen in soil exists in two forms,i.e. organic form and inorganic form (which include ammonium and nitrate) (Jones
et al. 2005 ). Although most of the nitrogen present in the soil is in organic form
(90–95%), most of it is not available directly for plant use. Therefore NO

and NH 4+(ammonium) make up most of the plant available nitrogen. Unlike
ammonium ions, nitrate ions are free ﬂowing in soil and do not bind to negatively
charged cations in soil. Thus, it is more readily available for plants (Courty et al.2015 ). Despite most of the organic nitrogen sources being unavailable, some of them
can be converted to available forms by microorganisms. Uptake of organic nitrogenis very energy ef ﬁcient for plants because the assimilation step (conversion of
inorganic nitrogen compounds into organic products) is bypassed (Chapin et al.
2002 ).
The relative proportion of different forms of nitrogen absorbed by plants can
depend on various interacting factors (Fig. 7.3). Even though a lot is not known
about these factors and how they interact, the relative amount of nitrogen present insoil is considered one of the major factors (Chapin et al. 2002 ; von Wirén et al.
1997 ). Other factors like pH of the soil, moisture, temperature, availability of a",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,168

particular nitrogen form and amount of potassium available in the soil (alleviate
ammonium toxicity) might be some of the soil properties determining N form uptake
(Britto and Kronzucker 2013 ). Competition experienced by other plants and micro-
organisms might play their role in N-availability. Symbiotic relationships on theother hand can increase plant ’s ability to absorb certain N forms (Kuzyakov and Xu
2013 ; Li et al. 2012 ). The species of a plant also might determine the form of
nitrogen uptake because the transporters of N vary in every plant species. Thedevelopment stage of the plant can also be a factor (Britto and Kronzucker 2002 ).

of rhizosphere however depends on the species of plant and microbes (Supriya 2018 )164 R. Parashar et al.",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,168
"Rhizosphere can be classi ﬁed into three zones, i.e. the inner zone (Closest to the
root), Rhizoplane (Root system) and Outer zone (adjoining epidermis). Rhizosphereis favourable for microbial growth due to the presence of root exudates (the organic
and in-organic compounds that ooze out of the root during unfavourable conditions).
This helps in forming a link between plants and microbes (Krasilnikov 1961 ).
Organic root exudates include compounds like proteins, vitamins, sugars, enzymes,etc. Inorganic root exudates include compounds like water, gases like oxygen,nitrogen, etc. Other than these, some miscellaneous compounds like auxins, glyco-sides, etc. are also released which might create a negative impact.
In the rhizosphere, deposition of root exudates serves as food and nutrition for
microbes. These microbes convert the complex compounds into simpler compounds
and these simple compounds can now be consumed by plants through roots (Supriya",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,169

plants with different forms of nitrogen. There are many omics approaches used forsoil ecology (Fig. 7.1). Studies have also suggested that the nitrogen cycling abilities
of these microbes change with changes in external conditions, i.e. soil structure,temperature, pH, etc. (Cobo-Díaz et al. 2015 ). Even after such major advances, in
understanding the interactions between microbes and plants, we are still not verysure about how uptake of different nitrogen forms is modulated. In this chapter, we

microbes process different sources of nitrogen.
7.2 Microbial Communities in Rhizosphere
The existence of huge microbial diversity in the rhizosphere zone is due to the
nutrition provided by root exudates and the favourable conditions like optimum pH,
temperature, moisture, etc. These communities include bacteria, actinomycetes,fungi, algae and protozoa majorly (Fig. 7.2). These microbes can be either bene ﬁcial,
deleterious or neutral in nature (Supriya 2018 ).
Beneﬁcial ones include the group of microbes which are of bene ﬁt to the root

Beneﬁcial ones include the group of microbes which are of bene ﬁt to the root
system of plant, for example, mycorrhizal fungi, N

N2ﬁxation, promoting plant growth, colonizing root, increasing absorption capacity
of roots. Deleterious ones are those which cause harm to the root systems which
includes nematodes, pathogens, etc. Neutral ones are those which show a neutral
effect, i.e. neither harm nor bene ﬁt the plants (Table 7.1).
Certain organic growth factors like vitamins, auxins, some biotic elements are of
great importance for microbial growth. It was observed that small doses of thesesubstances were able to increase the growth of microbes and plants by promotingvarious biochemical processes.

"importance and thus its quantity and total number of microbial populations can be
assumed to be directly proportional (Krasilnikov 1961 ).
7.3 Relation Between Plants and Microorganisms
Over the course of hundreds of years, plants have evolved various mutualistic
associations with certain microbes which majorly include some fungi and bacteria.
The most prominent example being that of Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi
which forms association with plant roots (Parniske 2008 ). 20% of the Carbon
(C) is allocated to mycelia. Other than carbon it takes up nitrate, ammonium and
provide Nitrogen to plants in return (Hodge and Storer 2015 ). This increases the
nutrient absorption by plants and thus increases plant growth. Talking about bacte-
ria, plants form mutualistic interactions with bacteria that can ﬁx atmospheric N 2to
produce ammonia. This interaction takes place in the root nodules of plants where

and microorganisms in each other ’s life, we will discuss their effects in detail.

"7.3.1 Effect of Plants on Soil Micro ﬂora
Plants in ﬂuence microorganism while alive and after their death. When they are
alive, the root exudates and dying parts of roots provide nutrition for the microor-ganism ’s optimal growth in rhizosphere region. After their death, the leftovers of the
plants nourish the soil and indirectly create favourable conditions for microbes toproliferate (Krasilnikov 1961 ).
7.3.1.1 Root Mass of Plants
Surface layer of soil constitutes the major root mass, i.e. the density of roots is
highest in surface layer (Kachinski ĭet al. 1950 ). This density keeps on decreasing as
we move deeper into the soil. Climatic conditions, type of ﬂora and fauna also affect
root mass.

The signi ﬁcance of root system is dependent on its activity, i.e. ability to absorb
nutrition from the surroundings. In return, products of metabolism are excreted,which are used by microbes to grow. Thus, higher root mass means more microbes(Krasilnikov 1961 ). This clearly shows that root mass has a direct and immense
inﬂuence on the growth and development of microorganisms. It may be positive or
negative.Table 7.1 Microbes found in rhizosphere with their features and functions

"7.3.1.2 Root Excretions
Roots are not only responsible for absorbing nutrients from the soil, but also excrete
certain substances which play major role in determining fertility of soil. CO 2is one
of the major excretions by roots. The intensity of CO 2formation by roots is directly
inﬂuenced by the number of microorganisms in soil. Root excretions also include
elements like Phosphorus, Potassium, Calcium, Sodium, etc. (Minina 1927 ; Sabinin
1940 ). Excretion from roots is achieved by the process of exosmosis. This happens
in accordance with the concentration gradients across root membrane (Minina 1927 ;
Sabinin 1940 ).
Plants were also found to excrete acetic, formic and oxalic acid through roots
(Stoklasa et al. 1909 ). It was also observed that metabolic products can be transferred
from one plant to another in an experiment where two plants were grown in a vessel,

time of incubation, the substance was detected in the unsprayed plant, henceshowing that the non-sprayed plant absorbed the substance from the sprayed plantvia soil (Preston et al. 1954 ).
Roots of vegetative plants also secrete certain enzymes in soil. The nature and
amount of enzyme secreted vary in different plant species (Virtanen et al. 1937 ). All
these substances are in some way or the other, nutritional sources for microorgan-isms in soil and are responsible for increase in growth.

Different products are formed as a result of this decomposition. These products arethe basis of nutrition for some of the other species of microbes (Krasilnikov 1961 ).
This shift of microbial population causes versatility in the ﬁnal fauna.
7.3.2 Effect of Soil Microorganisms on Plants
The effect of soil micro ﬂora on life of plants has not been studied very vastly and
only a little information is available. Microbes can either effect plant growthpositively or negatively. We will talk about both the aspects.
7.3.2.1 Microbial Activators
These are the microorganisms which can produce biotic factors like vitamins, amino
acids, etc. They are responsible for activating processes in soil (Zimmermann 1902 ).7 Unravelling Microbial Nitrogen Pathway in Rhizosphere 169",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,173

Root nodule bacteria which act as microbial activators are thought to ﬁx molecular
nitrogen and supply it to plants (Krasilnikov 1961 ).

are responsible for suppression of growth and development of plant (Greig-Smith

responsible for toxin production are some Protozoa, bacteria belonging to genusPseudomonas . Under certain conditions, the toxin produced might endow soil with
its toxicity. Level of toxicity depends upon rate of toxin production by
microorganisms.
7.4 Microbial Nitrogen Pathways
In terrestrial ecosystems, the availability of Nitrogen is limited, which results incompetition in soil fauna and ﬂora. To deal with this shortage of nitrogen, plants and
microbes have developed ways to utilize other organic and mineral compounds as asource of Nitrogen (Merrick and Edwards 1995 ). Main sources of organic Nitrogen",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,174
"microbes have developed ways to utilize other organic and mineral compounds as asource of Nitrogen (Merrick and Edwards 1995 ). Main sources of organic Nitrogen
are usually plant and animal residue (Kögel-Knabner 2002 ). Proteins are the most
important of them all, constituting 60% of organic nitrogen in soil (Cochrane 1958 ;
Sinha 2004 ). A small proportion is also ful ﬁlled by mineral sources like ammonium
and nitrate (Schimel and Bennett 2004 ). Glutamate and glutamine are also used as
nitrogen sources by various microorganisms (Wong et al. 2008 ). There are two broad
pathways of utilizing nitrogen from soil:
1.MIT route : This stands for mineralization-immobilization turnover. This is the
step where nitrogen is ﬁrst mineralized to NH
4+before use by microbes and
plants. When MIT route is dominant in soil, competition is experienced between
plants and microbes (Manzoni and Porporato 2007 ).

ment from organic resources while plants use mineral sources, hence no compe-tition is experienced (Manzoni and Porporato 2007 ).170 R. Parashar et al.",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,174
"7.4.1 Extracellular Depolymerase
Organic polymerase released as residue from plants and microbes needs to be
degraded to soluble forms before being utilized by microbe. This is done with thehelp of extracellular depolymerases. For hydrolysing/degrading nitrogen containingmolecules, depolymerases like protease, chitinase and peptidoglycan hydrolases aremost common. Protease can be produced by a wide variety of bacteria and fungi(Ahearn et al. 1968 ; Gupta et al. 2002 ) and has wide substrate speci ﬁties (Kalisz
1988 ). Extracellular protease is responsible for hydrolysing large protein molecules
into smaller peptides and amino acids.
Chitinase is a polymerase secreted by wide variety of bacteria, fungi, plants but
not archaea (Gooday 1990 ). It is found abundantly in nature. Chitinase produced by
bacteria hydrolyses chitin. When produced by fungi, they also play role in cell walldevelopment (Adams 2004 ; Bhattacharya et al. 2007 ).

"bacteria hydrolyses chitin. When produced by fungi, they also play role in cell walldevelopment (Adams 2004 ; Bhattacharya et al. 2007 ).
7.4.1.1 Regulation
Production of extracellular hydrolases is regulated by the presence or absence of
substrate. Here, substrate refers to the residues. For example, protease is activated by
presence of protein in the medium (Kalisz 1988 ) so is chitinase activated by the pres-
ence of chitin (Felse and Panda 1999 ). Carbon sources in the medium might supress
production of these enzymes. For example, glucose might repress product of prote-ase and chitinase (Duo-Chuan 2006 ). It was also found that inducing substrate in soil
might affect production of enzymes by microbes. For example, protein inductionincreased the protease activity in Tundra soil (Zanuta and Bremner 1976 ). Similar
results were obtained in case of chitinase (Rodriguez-Kabana et al. 1983 ).

"results were obtained in case of chitinase (Rodriguez-Kabana et al. 1983 ).
Protease synthesis was repressed under limiting Nitrogen and Sulphur condition
(Sims and Wander 2002 ) but in contrast it was observed that glucose addition to agar
increases protease activity (Asmar et al. 1992 ). Due to different results in different
conditions, it was believed that certain factors like soil age, fertility, type ofmicrobes, etc. determine the result of an addition or reduction.

Now, that the organic molecules have been depolymerized by respectivedepolymerases, they are ready for mineralization. This is via the MIT route wetalked about earlier. It includes mineralization of organic molecules to ﬁnally form
ammonium (NH

of degradation of uric acid extracted by birds (Cunin et al. 1986 ). More importantly
urease can be produced by bacteria, algae, fungi and even plants (Mobley andHausinger 1989 ; Follmer 2008 ). As in the case of protease and chitinase, urease
synthesis too is repressed in presence of a more suitable nitrogen source andincreased when urea is added (Mobley et al. 1995 ). It is estimated that most of the
urease activity is extracellular, i.e. about 60% of total in soil (Pettit et al. 1976 ). Later
it was believed that urease activity in soil was not a result of urea released by animalsbut because of urea produced by microbes and plants. This was believed on the basis",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,176
"it was believed that urease activity in soil was not a result of urea released by animalsbut because of urea produced by microbes and plants. This was believed on the basis
of experiment carried out by (Zanuta and Bremner 1976 ). When tests were carried
out in soil, it was found that addition of urea did not promote urease activity (Lloydand Sheaffe 1973 ). Presence of protected extracellular urease could be one of the
reasons or repression by NH
4+. Addition of Carbon increases urease activity, this is
because of the increased nitrogen demand by microorganisms when carbon is added(Lloyd and Sheaffe 1973 ; Zanuta and Bremner 1976 ).
7.4.2.2 Amino-Acid Oxidase
Deamination of amino acids and uptake of ammonium are key reactions in nitrogen
ﬁxation, and these are carried out by amino-acid oxidase. This enzyme is mainly
intracellular but may be produced by some bacteria and fungi extracellularly a well

"intracellular but may be produced by some bacteria and fungi extracellularly a well
(on cell surface) (Böhmer et al. 1989 ; Braun et al. 1992 ; Davis et al. 2005 ). Some
amino acids are very substrate speci ﬁc; some have a broad spectrum (Braun et al.
1992 ). It has been found that production of amino-acid oxidases is repressed by
NH
4+ (Palenik and Morel 1990 ; Vallon et al. 1993 ), enhanced by Nitrogen starva-
tion (Davis et al. 2005 ). Amino acid in the presence of Carbon induces amino-acid
oxidases production (Vallon et al. 1993 ). Several fungal species like basidiomycetes
and ascomycetes as well as some bacterial species can produce amino-acid oxidases
(Braun et al. 1992 ; Davis et al. 2005 ) (Fig. 7.3).
7.5 Metagenomic Analysis
Metagenomics refers to study of genetic material recovered directly from environ-
mental samples. This can also be referred to as environmental genomics.172 R. Parashar et al.",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,176
"7.5.1 Metagenomic Analysis of Nitrogen Cycle
Nitrogen metabolism involves about 7 –8 pathways including ammonia assimilation,
nitrate and nitrite ammoni ﬁcation, nitric oxide synthase, allantoin utilization, cya-
nate hydrolysis, Dissimilatory nitrate reductase, denitri ﬁcation, and Nitrogen ﬁxa-
tion. To analyse nitrogen cycle pathway, metagenomics (Cobo-Díaz et al. 2015 )
was carried out in a study where soil sample was collected from Sierra NevadaNatural and National park and pyrosequencing was performed. About 520,430 reads
were obtained which were trimmed to 412,302 sequences. These sequences obtained
were studied and analysed with the help of genome library on the basis of functions aparticular set of genome performs. At subsystem level (2) 52% of sequence wereresponsible for ammonia assimilation, 16 of sequence for Nitrate ammoni ﬁcation. In",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,177
"subsystem 3, Nitric oxide synthetase was 9.1%, nitrosative stress was 0.65%,Allantonian utilization 5.18%, Dissimilatory nitrate reductase 4.19%, Denitri ﬁcation
2.33%, Nitrogen ﬁxation 1.33%. This analysis also helped in ﬁguring bacterial
community based on similarities found in proteins which are responsible for nitrogen
cycle. The percentage abundance of microbes in soil is as follows: Bacteroidetes —
42%, Proteobacteria —27%. Actinobacteria —14%, Firmicutes —2%,
Acidobacteria —6%, and others.
7.5.2 Response of Nitrogen Cycle to CO 2
Earlier studies were focussed on gene families like nifH (important for Nitrogen
ﬁxation) (Collavino et al. 2014 ), amoA (Nitri ﬁcation) (Bru et al. 2011 ; Leininger
et al. 2006 ).

"These studies suggested the importance of uncultured organisms in carrying out
these processes. When CO 2concentration is increases, it results in affecting several
processes that affect N-cycling. Increase in photosynthesis and plant growth release
more carbon into soil and in return demand more nitrogen. Therefore, microbial
nitrogen ﬁxation tends to increase under high concentration of CO 2(Luo et al. 2006 ;
Norby et al. 2010 ). Decrease in N- ﬁxation was also observed in some studies
(Hungate et al. 2004 ). Experiments (Tu et al. 2017 ) showed that long CO 2exposure,
produced a signi ﬁcant change in the number of gene families responsible for
dissimilatory nitrate reduction, N-Metabolism, N 2ﬁxation while no such change

7.6 Conclusion
After unravelling the nitrogen cycling pathways followed in rhizosphere region withthe help of metagenomics and metatranscriptomics approach, it can be concludedthat the abundance or absence of certain nutrients in soil can be responsible for thenitrogen cycling pathways followed by microorganisms.

Roles of Root Exudates in Different

Abstract The nitrogen cycle is greatly in ﬂuenced by soil microbes through their
transformation of different nitrogen compounds. Additionally, microbial diversity is
profoundly modi ﬁed by plant root exudates in the rhizosphere. Hence, root exudates
indirectly control different processes in the nitrogen cycle by modifying the micro-
bial community in the rhizosphere. We are beginning to understand more about the
roles of plant root exudates in nitrogen ﬁxation, nitri ﬁcation, denitri ﬁcation, anaer-
obic ammonium oxidation (anammox), dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium
(DNRA), nitrate reduction, nitrogen mineralization, and, ﬁnally, nitrogen uptake in

process involving root exudates, nodgenes, and other compounds released from
rhizobia and legume plants. Moreover, after nodulation, atmospheric nitrogen can be
ﬁxed and transformed into ammonia through biological processes involving the
nitrogenase enzyme. Root exudates are also used as a carbon energy source by
different microbial communities involved in asymbiotic nitrogen ﬁxation, denitri ﬁ-
cation, and the DNRA and anammox processes. Chemical fertilizers, including

contrast, anammox, which is a two-step process, operates mainly in marine ecosys-
tems and sediments. Better knowledge of these processes is needed so that urgent
attention can be paid to optimizing the use of nitrogen fertilizers and minimizing
their contributions to climate change and nitrogen pollution.

8.1 The Nitrogen Cycle: An Overview
In general, the nitrogen (N) cycle in different ecosystems and environments can be
summarized as a process of oxidation –reduction chemical reactions catalyzed by
archaea, rhizospheric microorganisms, algae, and plants (Fig. 8.1). Of the total six
nitrogen compounds, nitrate is completely oxidized, while ammonium is a fully
reduced form of nitrogen are regulated by these organisms. Free nitrogen gas, an
inorganic form of N, is present in the atmosphere and is not accessible to most livingorganisms, but N can be ﬁxed (biochemically), transported into plants and other
living things, and converted into its organic forms by diazotrophic prokaryotes andalso by lightning (geochemically) (Vitousek et al. 2013 ). These prokaryotes may be",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,183
"living things, and converted into its organic forms by diazotrophic prokaryotes andalso by lightning (geochemically) (Vitousek et al. 2013 ). These prokaryotes may be
archaea or bacteria, free living or in mutualistic cooperation, and can reduce nitrogento ammonia (Hoffman et al. 2014 ). Further, ammonia is biologically incorporated
into amines, transported from soil into different parts of plants, and ﬁnally converted
into diverse organic compounds (Krapp 2015 ). Additionally, through the nitri ﬁca-
tion process, ammonium can easily be oxidized by soil microbes and converted intonitrite, nitrate, and hydroxylamine (Hayatsu et al. 2008 ). The nitri ﬁcation and
two-step oxidation processes are biologically performed by bacteria or archaea,known as ammonium-oxidizing archaea (AOAs) and ammonium-oxidizing bacteria(AOBs), and nitrite-oxidizing bacteria, respectively (Prosser and Nicol 2012 ).",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,183
"Recently, the complete ammonia oxidation (comammox) process has beendescribed; through this biological process, both oxidative steps (conversion of
ammonium into nitrite and into nitrate) are performed by a single organism,
Nitrospira (Daims et al. 2015 ; van Kessel 2015 ). In contrast, the denitri ﬁcation
process —including reduction of nitrate to nitrite, nitric oxide, nitrous oxide, and,
ultimately, free nitrogen gas —is executed by soil microbes, including fungi, bacte-
ria, and archaea (Hayatsu et al. 2008 ). In addition to nitri ﬁcation and denitri ﬁcation,
two other processes —dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonia and anaerobic
ammonium oxidation (anammox) —are included in the N cycle (Rütting et al.
2011 ). The DNRA process —in which nitrate is used as an electron acceptor under
microaerophilic/anaerobic conditions, reduced to nitrite, and ﬁnally converted into
ammonia —is performed by fungi and bacteria, while nitrogen (Welsh et al. 2014 )

The concept of the N cycle changed at the beginning of the twenty- ﬁrst century
after the discovery of archaea and as a result of human interference in the form ofchemical fertilizer manufacturing to enhance crop production in current agricultural
practices (Offre et al. 2013 ). After the discovery of archaea and their nitrogen

"roles of prokaryotes in the N cycle were discussed by researchers (Prosser and Nicol
2012 ). AOAs are broadly disseminated and capable of nitri ﬁcation in acidic soil, but
this process may be inhibited by high concentrations of ammonium (Verhammeet al. 2011 ). The impact of human activities on the N cycle has been estimated by
data showing that the total amount of nitrogen ﬁxation by the Haber –Bosch process
in addition to other anthropogenic activity by human (210 Tg N/year) is greater than
than the total amount of N- ﬁxation by asymbiotic and symbitic process (203 Tg

fungi, etc.) also contend with each other to utilize nutrient sources of organic
materials (Bais et al. 2004 ). One of the most important metabolic processes in
plant roots is secretion of a variety of compounds into the rhizosphere (Badri andVivanco 2009 ). In this process, 5 –21% of photosynthetically ﬁxed carbon is secreted
through plant roots in the form of root exudates (Marschner 1995 ; Derrien et al.

plant and also depends on abiotic and biotic factors (Jones et al. 2004 ).

amount of mucilage synthesized was 11 –47 mg of dry matter per gram of root
(Nguyen 2003 ). The mucilage diffusion rate and quantity are determined by whether
the root is grown in a nutrient solution or in water (Sealey et al. 1995 ). Mucilage
secreted into soil helps to enhance the aggregation capability of soil, which promotesaeration of soil, prevents soil erosion, and supports root growth to maintain acontinuous ﬂow of water in the rhizosphere. Moreover, mucilage also protects the

metabolic activities by microbes and plants in the rhizosphere. For example, CO 2
diffuses into the rhizosphere after carbohydrate respiration in the process of plant –
microbe interaction (Phillips et al. 1999 ). Accumulation of CO 2in the rhizosphere

technique includes use of a radioisotope tracer in which a

plants. This has enabled estimation of a signi ﬁcant economic pro ﬁt from asymbiotic

"produced by plant photosynthates (Dong and Layzell 2001 ). H 2is released as a
by-product of N ﬁxation in legumes. Some rhizobia have a hydrogenase (Hup)
enzyme for uptake of H 2gas to produce energy by oxidation, but most rhizobia
lack a hydrogenase enzyme and are unable to use H 2gas. Ultimately, therefore, the
H2gas diffuses into the rhizosphere from root nodules (Golding et al. 2012 ). H 2gas
release after N ﬁxation is also helpful for modi ﬁcation of the soil microbiome and
contributes indirectly to plant growth (Dong and Layzell 2001 ). Simultaneously, H 2
gas stimulates the hydrogen-oxidizing rhizobial community, which can indirectly
boost plant growth –promoting activities, such as root elongation, by syntjesizing
IAA (Ahmad et al. 2020 ) and retarding ethylene releases from plant roots (Ahmad
et al. 2013 ). This is bene ﬁcial to nonleguminous and leguminous plants (Maimaiti

It is well established that root exudates are involved in development of symbiotic
relationships between legumes and rhizobia ( Bradyrhizobium ,Sinorhizobium ,Rhi-
zobium ,Mesorhizobium , etc.) in the rhizosphere. This is known as Rhizobium –
legume symbiosis (Oldroyd 2013 ; Philippot et al. 2013 ). Chemical compound

and naringenin), activate and synthesize nodulation factors (Hassan and Mathesius2012 ) through initiation or catalysis of expression of nodgenes in rhizobia (Begum
et al. 2001 ). Nodulation factors are host speci ﬁc and are classi ﬁed as

discharged LPO molecules bind to special receptors located in the plasma membraneof epidermal cells on legume root hairs and initiate the process of nodulation by
stimulating a calcium-dependent cascade (Ahmad et al. 2012 ; Oldroyd 2013 ).
Flavonoids are continuously secreted into the rhizosphere from legume roots, buttheir concentrations increase and they act as chemoattractants when compatibleRhizobium species are present in the rhizosphere (Zuanazii et al. 1998 ). Moreover,

"europaea was used as a bioindicator (Subbarao et al. 2007 ). BNI compounds were
tested in various species of plants, such as cereals, legumes, and plants from tropicaland temperate regions. BNI activity ranged between 0 and 18.3 AT (inhibitorallylthiourea/gm of root dry weight day

species of ﬁeld grass, pearl millet, cereals, legumes, and vegetables. Among pasture
grasses, BNI activity was greatest in Brachiaria decumbens andB. humidicola
(Subbarao et al. 2007 ). Many low- and high-BNI genotypes have been detected in
B. humidicola pasture grass. In a pot experiment, B. humidicola suppressed around
90% of the nitri ﬁcation process by releasing BNI compounds into the rhizosphere,
and the soil concentration of ammonium, as an inorganic form of nitrogen, remainedunchanged (Subbarao et al. 2007 ). Plants that release only small amounts of BNI

"compounds have been shown not to inhibit the nitri ﬁcation process; most of the
ammonia is oxidized and converted into nitrate in soil (Zakir et al. 2008 ; Subbarao
et al. 2012 ). Similarly, after screening, studies have revealed that other cereal crops
(maize, wheat, rice, and barley) do not secrete BNI compounds in their root exudates(Lata et al. 1999 ). Moreover, legumes do not interfere in the nitri ﬁcation process,
because they lack BNI capacity. Synthesis and exudation of BNI compounds by
sorghum, B. humidicola , and Leymus racemosus is inﬂuenced by the form of
nitrogen applied to soil. When nitrate was applied to soil, BNIs were not releasedfrom the roots, whereas after ammonia application to soil, BNIs compounds weresynthesized (Subbarao et al. 2013 ). Methyl 3-(3-hydroxyphenyl) propionate

"(MHPP) inhibits the denitri ﬁcation process and has been identi ﬁed in root exudates
from sorghum grown in ammonia-treated soil. MHPP inhibits the nitri ﬁcation
process via the ammonia monooxygenase (AMO) enzymatic pathway but does not
interfere in the hydroxylamine oxidoreductase (HAO) enzymatic pathway of
Nitrosomonas (Zakir et al. 2008 ). The BNI process can be exploited for management
of soil denitri ﬁcation processes in agronomic approaches.
Root exudates are equally important in serving as a C source for growth of the
bacterial population involved in the denitri ﬁcation process (Zhai et al. 2013 ). The
denitri ﬁcation process is inhibited by BNI compounds in root exudates, while
bacterial use of this C source to oxidize ammonia creates equilibrium in theN cycle in the rhizosphere. After the denitri ﬁcation process in the rhizosphere of

"Rhodobacterales and Pseudomonadales in the rhizosphere (Ai et al. 2017 ). Two
interlinked and important key processes in the N cycle that operate in differentecosystems (estuarine water, freshwater, and the ocean) are the anammox process
and denitri ﬁcation (Francis et al. 2007 ; Zhu et al. 2010 ). Between 31% and 41% of
N
2is emitted from the rhizosphere of rice, while only 2 –3% of N 2is released from
nonrhizospheric soil via the anammox process (Nie et al. 2018 ). A total of 79% of N
loss in marine ecosystems occurs through the anammox process. In contrast, deni-triﬁcation accounts for 87% of N loss in freshwater and soil (Schubert et al. 2006 ).
The diversity of anammox bacteria in the rhizospheres of submerged plants andsediments is in ﬂuenced by the concentrations of nitrate, ammonia, and organic
matter, and by redox potential and oxygen availability (Lee and Francis 2017 ).

The most important parameters for the anammox process are the availability of
dissolved oxygen (Oshiki et al. 2016 ) and salinity (Sonthiphand et al. 2014 )i n
submerged ecosystems. The ammonia-to-nitrate molar ratio also in ﬂuences the
anammox process. A phylogenetic analysis indicated that the anammox bacteriaBrocadia fuigida and Scalindua wagneri and the nirS denitrifying bacteria
Herbaspirillum andPseudomonas were the dominant species in sediment around
declined Potamogeton crispus . It was suggested that a sudden decline in submerged
macrophytes would increase the abundance of anammox bacteria and denitrifying
bacteria in a relatively short time (Hu et al. 2020 ).

"8.5 Root Exudates and the DNRA Process
The DNRA process is very critical in our understanding of soil ecosystems in
microaerophilic conditions and in the presence of nitrate (Stein and Klotz 2016 ).
While free N releases in atmosphere resulted loss of N during the denitri ﬁcation and
anammox processes (Can ﬁeld et al. 2010 ). Through N gas emissions, signi ﬁcant loss
of N occurs in the denitri ﬁcation and anammox processes, although the DNRA
process helps to retain N in the form of ammonia in aquatic systems (An and Gardner
2002 ). Ammonia is further taken up by plant roots, enhancing plant growth. In the
DNRA process, highly mobile nitrate and nitrite are reduced to ammonia (An andGardner 2002 ). DNRA activity is widely detected in soils or environments with
microaerophilic conditions, such as wetland systems (Gao et al. 2017 ; Zhang et al.

2017 ), terrestrial (forest, grassland, agriculrural land, dessert) habitats, ﬂoodplains
(Jones et al. 2017 ), and marine sediments (Cheng et al. 2016 ). The DNRA process is
also in ﬂuenced by the C-to-N and carbon-to-nitrate ratios in both terrestrial and
aquatic systems (Robertson et al. 2016 ; Zhou et al. 2017 ).
Chemolithoautotrophic and heterotrophic bacteria and other diverse microbes are
involved in the DNRA process (Pang and Ji 2019 ). Additionally, the nrfA gene,
which encodes nitrite reductase, has been developed as a biomarker gene for theDNRA process (Welsh et al. 2014 ). This gene has been identi ﬁed in diverse groups
of bacteria: Planctomycetes, Chloro ﬂexi, Bacteroides, Acidobacteria,
Planctomycetes, Firmicutes, and Verrucomicrobia (Welsh et al. 2014 ). The192 E. Ahmad et al.",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,195
"microbial diversity surrounding plant roots is greatly in ﬂuenced by root exudates in
terrestrial and aquatic habitats, and the DNRA process is indirectly affected by rootexudates as the population of microbes is manipulated. For example, in a recent
study, the DNRA rate, the abundance of Chthiniobacter , and the total organic matter
content were correlated in rhizospheric and nonrhizospheric soil. The DNRA rateswere higher in rhizospheric soils where larger populations of Chthiniobacter were
recorded than in nonrhizospheric soil because of the greater availability of C sourcesin rhizospheric soil (Pan et al. 2020 ).

root exudates from Medicago enhance N mineralization in the rhizosphere (De-la-
Pena and Vivanco 2010 ). Additionally, Godlewski and Adamczyk ( 2007 ) reported
that proteases were secreted in root exudates from 15 different types of wild andagricultural plant species. Later, they concluded that secretion of proteases from
wheat (Adamczyk et al. 2008 ) and allium (Adamczyk et al. 2009 ) was a strategy on
the part of the plants to mineralize complex organic forms of N into simple forms forutilization of nitrogen. Root uptake of amino acids from soil was studied using aproteomic and isotopic method in which radiolabeled glycine was used as a source ofnitrogen for uptake by Lolium perenne plants (Thornton et al. 2007 ). The microbial",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,196
"community in the rhizosphere also releases proteases and break down proteins intoamino acids. Proteases in root exudates or in the rhizosphere digest protein andconvert it into amino acids to facilitate N uptake by plant roots. These limited
ﬁndings clearly indicate that root exudates facilitate mineralization of N and its
further uptake by plants. In the N mineralization process, rhizospheric microbessecrete proteases that break down complex forms of N (in proteins and peptides) intosimple organic forms (in amino acids) and further convert them into ammonium.Carbon is one of the growth-limiting factors for microbes. Thus, this limitation ispartially controlled by exudates that are secreted from roots, move through soil, andtransform it into rhizospheric soil (Lynch and Whipps 1990 ).

Techniques for Improving Nitrogen Use
Efﬁciency in Rice
Sepideh Bagheri Novair, Babak Motesharezadeh, and

Abstract Nitrogen (N) is an essential macroelement for rice growth and develop-
ment in paddy ﬁelds. Nitrogen use ef ﬁciency (NUE) is an indicator of nitrogen
utilization in rice plants. Increasing NUE reduces nitrogen fertilizer consumption,
prevents N fertilizer loss and rice productivity. In the present study, fertilizer types,
water irrigation management, and rice cultivars are the factors for improving nitro-
gen use ef ﬁciency in rice. The organic compound application with controlled-release
N fertilizers in the soil is one of the effective techniques for NUE improvement. In
this chapter, we have paid to N increase necessity, its loss of environmental
consequences and increase plant yield.

9.1 Introduction
Nitrogen is an essential element for the growth of rice plants (Spiertz 2010 ). To crop
output increase, a lot of nitrogenous fertilizer is applied (Iqbal et al. 2020 ). Cereal
plants have nitrogen use ef ﬁciency by nearly 33%. The rest of nitrogen fertilizer use
efﬁciency is more than 65%, which causes a lot of ﬁnancial loss annually (Fig. 9.1)
(Raun and Johnson 1999 ), rise in the price of the crop, and to anthropological and
ecological dif ﬁculties (Iqbal et al. 2020 ). However, it is possible to increase NUE in
some ways (Fig. 9.2). The suitable methods are in the following (Iqbal et al. 2020 ):

Many studies about NUE are associated with irrigation, effective use of fertilizer,
uptake of nitrogen fertilizer from the soil, and application of nitrogen fertilizer forplant yield (Cassman et al. 1993 ; Ye et al. 2013 ; Cabangon et al. 2011 ). Evaluation
of each factor and its management has an effective role in determining it.
9.2 What Factors Does NUE Depend on?
If we want to summarize the effective detail factors on NUE in plant, we have to referto Fig. 9.3. However, the following general factors can be described: These factors
are two squares.
9.2.1 Application Fertilizer Types
Nitrogen recovery in rice is low, while it is signi ﬁcantly higher in the soil N pool

"(nearly 2 times) (Zistl-Schlingmann et al. 2020 ). Fertilizer nitrogen sources are used
to play an important role in NUE changes, for example, controlled-release urea vs
conventional urea (Guo et al. 2016 ) or organic and inorganic fertilizer (Behera et al.
2009 ) and N fertilizers with the new nitri ﬁcation inhibitor (NI) 3,4-dimethyl
pyrazole phosphate (Pasda et al. 2001 ).
9.2.2 Water Irrigation Management

"alternation irrigation and N application provide better rice growth, yield, and N
utilization. Its reason is that increased glutamine synthetase and glutamate synthaseactivity in root rice (Sun et al. 2012 ). Alternate wetting and drying (AWD) are better
than continuous ﬂooding on plant NUE, while N fertilization as controlled-release
nitrogen fertilizer application considerably increased NUE (Ye et al. 2013 ). Moder-
ate AWD is an important practice in progressive integrative crop management to theincrease in NUE rice (Zhang 2018 ).
In some studies, only AWD (without amendment) decreased water input and
nitrogen fertilizer controlling without a negative impact on NUE rice. It can be statedthat the alternative irrigation regime is convenient for low water areas (Cabangonet al. 2004 ).

The choice of enhanced (NUE) genotypes is important to decrease N input. These
plants can absorb, use, and the remobilization of N from in soils and help sustainableagriculture (Mauceri et al. 2020 ). Duan et al. ( 2007 ) stated that Nanguang is a high-
NUE cultivar and Elio is a Low-NUE rice cultivar in chins. Change in ratio N-NH
4/
N-NO 3until to 3 increased N accumulation in the high-NUE cultivar more than the
Low-NUE rice cultivar. Yang Dao had signi ﬁcantly greater NUE than Nong Ken for
rice production. Application of a variety of nitrogenous compounds increased yield.Nitroxin and nano potassium consumption are used in two Iranian rice cultivars.Tarom Hashemi has a higher yield than Tarom Mahalli (Lemraski et al. 2017 ).

2020 ).Japonica and indica-japonica rice cultivar were grown in Progressive inte-
grative crop management caused to improve NUE, grain yield agronomic, andphysiological achievements (Zhang 2018 ).
Wuyunjing 7, Nanguang, and 4007 are high NUE and Elio is a low-NUE rice
cultivar. Elio had fewer reproductive tillers due to a reduced amount of demand for Nduring rice middle growth (Zhang et al. 2009 ).
9.3 Some Methods to Increase Nitrogen Use Ef ﬁciency
in Rice
The increase of NUE in the non-N2 ﬁxing crops (for example rice) is done according
to the growing population need of the world (via improved NUE cultivars andmanaging) (Raun and Johnson 1999 ). For this purpose, there is a need to recognize
newer methods (Table 9.1).206 S. Bagheri Novair et al.",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,208
"Nitrogen and water irrigation management is a widespread technique to meet of
rice production. Nitrogen –water management reduces N application and water
irrigation by 20% and increases N uptake in rice plants (Yang et al. 2020 ).
Zeolite application (as soil amendment) with urea (as N fertilizer) improved NUE
in rice (Kavoosi 2007 ).
Controlled-release urea applications could reduce N losses, yield increase, and N
quantity in straw and grain (Guo et al. 2016 ).
9.4 Nitrogen Forms as a Particular Index

The application of organic amendments (rice straw and azolla compost) increased
the concentration of total nitrogen in paddy ﬁelds (Novair et al. 2020 ).
9.6 Agricultural Managements
Agricultural management will change NUE in according to different points in
agriculture and climate conditions. Some studies investigated that intensive and
extensive management with slurry applications. The nitrogen harvest of intensive
management is more than extensive management (Zistl-Schlingmann et al. 2020 ).
Another issue is soil tillage condition in paddy ﬁelds (tillage and no-till condi-
tions and with and without cover). Continuous no-till and covering showed to
increase NUE and WUE (Habbib et al. 2020 ).

"One of the most effective ways to reduce nitrogen loss, urea must be applied with
a nitri ﬁcation inhibitor (3,4-dimethyl pyrazole phosphate, DMPP) and urease inhib-
itor (n-butyl thiophosphoric triamide, NBPT). These applications increased recoveryof N and reduced N loss in the soil (Wallace et al. 2020 ).
Integrative crop management along with moderate alternative drying-rewetting
are techniques in higher NUE and productivity (Zhang 2018 ).
9.7 Laboratory Analysis Types
Indicators related to the measurement of NUE rice are photosynthesis parameters
and water-use recovery. Leaf area, and chlorophyll are factors related to photosyn-thesis parameters. Transpiration rate and stomatal conductance are factors related towater-use recovery (Habbib et al., 2020 ).

"In summary, the main effects of increasing fertilizer nitrogen concentration on the
environment can be described as follows (Fig. 9.6) (Kant et al. 2011 ; Bashir et al.

Fig. 9.6 Impact of excess N fertilizer input210 S. Bagheri Novair et al.",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,212
"However, different results were observed in this regard. Chen et al. ( 2020 )
observed that higher-NUE genotypes do not decrease ammonia volatilization. Itcan be done in other loss ways because low NUE causes excess N concentration in
the soil condition (Johnson and Raun 2003 ).

surface and subsurface waters, algal growth and greenhouse gas emissions.
(/C0) High concentration nitrogen fertilizer (NH4+) reserved the total root expan-
sion (Chen et al. 2013 ).
(/C0) Leached ammonium is transferred to underground water and transformed to
NH3 and it accelerated nitri ﬁcation reactions rapidly in the soil pore spaces. Then,
nitrates changed to gaseous (denitri ﬁcation) upon drainage (nitri ﬁcation-

9.9 Conclusion
It is important to improve the NUE today to reduce the negative environmental
effects, increase crop yield, and decrease N fertilizer use in the twenty- ﬁrst century.
Increasing NUE plays an important role in improving rice growth and reducing theloss of different forms of nitrogen. It is possible with the application of N fertilizercompounds, ﬁeld management, type rice cultivar (high NUE), and irrigation regime.
According to the listed content, the organic application is the best way to increase
nitrogen maintenance in the soil.

Abstract The fundamental element of the nitrogen cycle is considered to be the
biological nitrogen ﬁxation which is naturally providing the ﬁxed nitrogen to the
Earth ’s ecosystem. The process of ﬁxing nitrogen has been widely researched and
the microorganisms carrying out nitrogen ﬁxation process have been identifying and
studied for their role in ecosystem. The identi ﬁcation and characterization of nitro-
genﬁxers involve number of techniques and tools and some of these techniques have
been discussed in the present chapter.

is highly variable in soil depending on various properties and parameters likeoxygen, temperature, moisture of soil, physiochemical activity, and activities ofnitrifying, denitrifying microbes present in the soil (Schimel and Bennett 2004 ).
Due to ﬂexible metabolism of plants, they are highly capable of adapting their
metabolism with ﬂuctuating levels of nitrogen thus making these metabolisms
sensitive and selective so that facilitative uptake and assimilation of nitrogenbecomes easy to promote growth under limiting conditions of nitrogen. These

10.2 Nitrogen Fixation
Nitrogen is considered as an essential element for growth of plants and important forall living organisms present on earth thus it is cycled in the ecosystem by the processofﬁxation. This ﬁxation is carried out in various ways. Natural processes that ﬁx
atmospheric nitrogen into biosphere are lightening and biological nitrogen ﬁxations.
Net nitrogen which is to be ﬁxed per year is ﬁxed in the form of ammonia and 1% of
ammonia from net nitrogen is ﬁxed by lightening (Igarashi and Seefeldt 2003 ),
whereas biological nitrogen ﬁxation (BNF) is usually carried out by group of
microbes which are usually distributed among archaeal and bacterial domains(Vitousek et al. 1997 ) termed as diazotrophs (Postgate 1982 ). Total of 50% nitrogen

"isﬁxed biologically per year (Igarashi and Seefeldt 2003 ). There is another process
which helps in ﬁxing the remaining 50% of atmospheric nitrogen available, Haber
Bosch process. This process leads to reduction of atmospheric nitrogen into ammo-nia by reacting with hydrogen under high temperature and pressure by using iron as
catalyst (Jennings 2013 ; Vojvodic et al. 2014 ). This process leads to revolution
agricultural production as it is useful in ful ﬁlling the immediate requirement of
nitrogen as a fertilizer. Fixing of nitrogen by industrial means has harmful conse-quences which lead to emission of nitrogen oxides, water eutrophication, and soilacidiﬁcation (Dixon and Kahn 2004 ). Ecological and economical effective measure

expensive metabolic process as it utilizes 16 molecules of energy that is ATP forﬁxing a molecule of nitrogen into two molecules of ammonia (Simpson and Burris

Dinitrogenases : It consists of complex protein which is a heterotrimer and formed
as MoFeS protein, whereas dinitrogenase reductase lacks Fe protein but contains
manganese superoxide oxidoreductase (Zhao et al. 2006 ). It lacks the property of
reducing acetylene into ethylene, has low requirement of MgATP and is insen-sitive to oxygen thus needs oxide ions for completing the process of reduction of
atmospheric nitrogen into ammonia (Zhao et al. 2006 ).
Diazotrophes are important as they express complex of nitrogenase enzyme
which has a role of carrying out nitrogen ﬁxation. This complex formed of bacterial
nitrogenase enzymes is considered as the only natural complex known to reduce
nitrogen into ammonia (Seefeldt et al. 2009 ). There are several sets of nitrate10 Tools for Characterization of Nitrogen Fixing Microbes 217",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,218

was done by placing Nitrosococcus oceanus in the γ-proteobacteria and other strains

"samples are usually obtained from inorganic ammonium containing medium whichis enriched (Allison and Prosser 1992 ). Oversight of natural carbon disheartens;
however, does not wipe out heterotrophs, which develop on natural results ofammonia oxidizer growth and on unpredictable natural mixes of different saltsforming volatile compounds or contaminants of media and culture vessels.End-point dilution method was used to obtain enriched liquid cultures which are
considered as pure cultures. In the two cases, ﬁltration is made troublesome by the
moderate development and low yield of ammonia oxidizers on research facilitymedia. For instance, for producing microbial colonies, incubation of several weekson solid medium is required. A combination of end-point dilution and enumerationby most probable number method has been done in some studies with identi ﬁcation",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,227
"and isolation of various microorganisms from several cultures exhibiting enhance-ment in growth at higher dilutions (Belser and Schmidt 1978 ). An opportunity for
determination of physical traits related to environment is been provided by pure
cultures. But this approach has been limited due to dif ﬁculty in cultivation of
ammonia oxidizers and restricted pure cultures availability. These are exacerbatedby the slow growth of ammonia oxidizers in liquid culture and on solid media and by226 C. Shandilya et al.",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,227
"the fact that pure cultures, once obtained, are dif ﬁcult to keep free of contamination
and often die out with repeated subculture. Despite these disadvantages, successfulenrichment of a particular strain is necessary for unequivocal evidence of its
presence and viability in an environment. In addition, laboratory cultures provide
the potential for development of antibodies speci ﬁc to particular groups, again
allowing direct detection of target organisms in environmental samples. Character-ization of pure cultures led to the traditional classi ﬁcation of autotrophic ammonia
oxidizers into ﬁve genera, based on cell morphology and a limited number of
additional phenotypic characters. Con ﬁrmation of taxonomic groupings, including
species descriptions, has been achieved using DNA:DNA hybridization of purecultures of these organisms but this approach is necessarily limited by the dif ﬁculties

"in obtaining pure cultures of ammonia oxidizers. Identi ﬁcation of cultures using the
available phenotypic characters is also dif ﬁcult and these problems have restricted
studies of natural diversity of autotrophic ammonia oxidizers to those utilizingimmunological techniques (Belser and Schmidt 1978 ; Ward and Carlucci 1985 )
and long-term isolation programs.
10.4.2 Acetylene Reduction Assay
Acetylene reduction assay (ARA) was performed with a single colony of bacteriagrown in N-free WAT4C semisolid medium. The cultures were incubated for 72 h at
28
/C14C, and then acetylene enriched atmospheres to a ﬁnal concentration of 1% and
10% were injected. Acetylene was produced by dissolving calcium carbide in tapwater and injected to a ﬁnal concentration of 1% (v/v) by replacement of an identical
volume of air. The acetylene reduction activity was measured with a Varian 3300(Walnut Creek, CA, USA) gas chromatograph with a ﬂame ionization detector.",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,228

Klebsiella variicola ATCC BAA-830 T and Escherichia coli DH10b were included
as positive and negative controls, respectively.
Acetylene reduction assay (ARA) can be utilized for identifying nitrogen ﬁxers. It
has implemented for sorghum roots grown in ﬁelds at different growth stages
(Schollhorn and Burris 1967 ). Random sampling of healthy plants was done to
perform ARA with acetylene and one control without acetylene. 10% concentrationof acetylene gas was maintained and injected followed by incubation for 1 day.Ethylene levels were estimated in collected gas samples with gas chromatographywith ﬂame ionization. The activity of nitrogen ﬁxation was observed at different
growth levels in 04 sorghum cell lines by ARA in closed bottles. Since, emission ofethylene is favored by sorghum plants, ARA of bacterial nitrogenase was measured",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,228

as the difference in the rate of ethylene formation in the presence and absence of
acetylene. It was found that at early stages no ARA was present in the seedlings.However, signi ﬁcant ARA values (KM1, 36.1 nmol per plant per h, KM2, 52.6 nmol10 Tools for Characterization of Nitrogen Fixing Microbes 227",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,228

were observed. Roots of all the four sorghum lines showed signi ﬁcant rise in ARA
values at 102 days after treatment in comparison to 71 days. Also, ARA of cell lines
differed between the growth stages hence indicating that root ARA has dependency
upon the sorghum genotype (Hara et al. 2019 ).
10.4.3 Detecting Nitrogen Concentration Using Nitrogen
Isotope
The biological nitrogen ﬁxation is an essential process for proving nitrogen in
available form to the biosphere. Among nitrogen ﬁxers, the free-living diazotrophs
residing in soil act as the dominating source of ﬁxed N in ecosystem; however, there
is still requirement of studies to know about their ecological and evolutionarysigniﬁcance (Cleveland et al. 1999 ). The key property is the nifH nitrogenase
gene. The microbial diversity that harbors nitrogenase sequence is largely",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,229
"gene. The microbial diversity that harbors nitrogenase sequence is largely
unidenti ﬁed diazotrophs, which can also be the dominant communities for nitrogen
ﬁxation (Hamelin et al. 2002 ; Tan et al. 2003 ). The identi ﬁcation of non-culturable
diazotrophs can be done by detecting their nifH sequences; however, only limitedamount of information can be gathered via this process because nigH gene phylo-genetics is not consistent to the phylogeny of the organism (Raymond et al.2004a ,b). Hence, the use of stable isotope probing using
15N2-DNA (15N2-DNA-
SIP) can be done for linking particular 16 s rRNA genes with N2- ﬁxing process. The
SIP process enable ﬁnding the link with 16 s rRNA genes of non-culturable
diazotrophs with respect to their nifH genes and can also give the genomic fragmentsto be used in characterizing diazotrophs along with their ecological importance(Buckley et al. 2007 ).

"In a study, three distinct microbial groups have been identi ﬁed by applying
15N2-
DNA-SIP. These groups have not been earlier associated with N 2-ﬁxation. They
belonged to the uncharacterized and unclassi ﬁed Betaproteobacteria and
Actinobacteria (Buckley et al. 2007 ). Roley et al. ( 2019 ) studied the atmospheric
nitrogen ﬁxation in switchgrass by enriching the N 2with isotope15N under in vitro,
greenhouse and ﬁeld studies. It was observed that N 2ﬁxation took place in early
stage greenhouse experiments and it took 3-month time in ﬁeld trails. Further, the
microbial diversity in the soil was shaped according to the nitrogen fertilization(Fig. 10.1).228 C. Shandilya et al.",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,229

Sonam Singh, Mehjabeen, O. Siva Devika, and Amitava Rakshit
Abstract A recent review of worldwide data on nitrogen use ef ﬁciency warrants an
immediate intervention of best management practices which will optimize best
fertilizers option, farmer pro ﬁtability and crop productivity. Nitrogen being a pri-
mary nutrient is critical for congenial plant growth. Additionally, the risk to human
health due to indiscriminate use and concern due to energy intensive production of
this input paves the way for use of bio-inoculants as the possible link for better
utilization and use ef ﬁciency. Biopriming which involves seed priming in combina-
tion with low dosage of bene ﬁcial microbes has emerged as the most feasible
eco-friendly supplement to the existing integrated plant nutrition system. In this

Non-renewable Energy
India is the second most populous country after china. India is primarily an agricul-
tural country as 65% of its people depend on agriculture for their livelihood. Farmers
of India mostly rely on organic manures for supplementing soil until middle of
twentieth century. However, with the emergence of green revolution during early
1960s, demand and consumption of synthetic fertilizers increased per unit area

time of green revolution required higher input which was then ful ﬁlled by fertilizers.
As a consequence, Indian soils become less and less fertile. Out of many reports ofnutrient de ﬁciency, nitrogen (N) de ﬁciency is the ﬁrst one to be reported in Indian
soil. As a result consumption of nitrogenous fertilizers was increased sharply from0.06 million ton (Mt) in 1950 –1951 to 10.8 Mt. in 2000 –2001, about 190-fold
increase in 50 years after independence (Pathak et al. 2010 ). Green revolution causes

3) production is a primary stage for nitrogenous fertilizers as it is basic
chemical used in their production (Ray 2011 ). Production of NH 3at a large scale is
mainly carried out by Haber –Bosch process. Ammonia is produced using N 2and H 2
from the atmosphere at a very high temperature and pressure. Harsh condition during
the process results lower ef ﬁciency level than desirable for sustainable fertilizer

Nitrogen requirement for plant is more than any other nutrient and is a key compo-

Nitrogen plays major role in growth and development of plant and is acritical limiting element in soil. Though nitrogen quantity is ample in atmosphere, inIndian soils nitrogen is universally de ﬁcient element for pro ﬁtable crop production

farmers may apply excess fertilizers that exceed agronomic recommendations. Toget rid of this complication focus should be on management approaches and newinterventions to supplement costly fertilizers, to meet crop requirement and increaseefﬁciency especially for nitrogen. Management options are more effectual if it can
target the ef ﬁciency of rhizosphere which is directly in ﬂuenced by root secretions

"11.4 Probable Mechanism Involved
Nitrogen is the second most limited nutrient for plants growth after water (Malik
et al. 2001 ), despite its abundant concentration in atmosphere (78%). Nitrogen is
present in the atmosphere as dinitrogen gas (N 2) and has triple bonded structure
(N/C17N) because of which very high energy is required to take that forms directly by
plant (Shridhar 2012 ). Certain microbial species have the special ability to ﬁx
atmospheric N into ammonical form with the help of nitrogenase system (Halbleiband Ludden 2000 ). Use of synthetic nitrogenous fertilizer in agriculture is the most
popular method of providing suf ﬁcient nutrient concentration to the plants. Long
term and imbalance use of nitrogenous fertilizers lead to many environmental issues.
Therefore, use of bio-inoculants can improve nitrogen use ef ﬁciency by various

"Therefore, use of bio-inoculants can improve nitrogen use ef ﬁciency by various
ways listed below:
1. Increase total surface area of root which improve N uptake either by increase in
root growth, more branching and root hairs formation or by addition of extension
in prevailing root system (e.g. mycorrhizal associations) (Saia et al. 2014 ).
2. Direct contribution of nutrient in soil solution pool either by biological N- ﬁxation
(BNF) or by changing the kinetics of rhizospheric processes (e.g. mineralization,nitriﬁcation inhibition, etc.) (Mohammadi and Sohrabi 2012 ).
3. Through microbial biomass turnover in the rhizosphere (Richardson et al. 2009 ).
Of all the mechanisms listed above, BNF is the most popular and ef ﬁcient one.
Biological nitrogen ﬁxation is enzymatic conversion of dinitrogen into NH

Nitrogenase consists of two separate metalloprotein called larger dinitrogenase
(Mo-Fe protein) and smaller dinitrogenase reductase (Fe protein) (Pathak and kumar2017). Firstly Fe protein interacts with ATP and Mg
2+, accepts electron from
ferredoxin or ﬂavodoxin and becomes reduced. Finally electron ﬂow takes place
from reduced Fe protein to oxidized Mo-Fe protein and it is reduced (Fig. 11.2). It is
the reduced species of Mo-Fe protein which combine with N 2and other substrates to
yield NH 3.
Nitrogen ﬁxation by bacterial species is carried out either by symbiotic, associa-
tive or free living relationship between plants and bacteria. In symbiotic association,

11.5 Biopriming Mediated NUE in Different Crops
Several works have been done on biopriming particularly to improve nitrogen use
efﬁciency. Increase in nitrogen use ef ﬁciency means the plant can ef ﬁciently utilize
the nitrogen and is able to assimilate the nutrient into its chlorophyll, nucleic acids,protein content, etc. Different mechanisms have been explained by various investi-
gators as the reason behind this increment in use ef ﬁciency of nitrogen. This increase
is attributed to different functions of biopriming agents —N-ﬁxation, nitrogenase
activity, plant growth promoting activities, etc. (Table 11.4)

11.6 Conclusions and Way Forward
Green revolution led to the adoption of high yielding varieties whose seeds lay
primarily on chemical fertilizers especially nitrogen which is produced throughhighly energy intensive process. Indian soils are poor in nitrogen status and almostall soils respond to the application of external nitrogen. As fossil fuels are expensive,cost of fertilizers is still at high which increase economic burden to farmer. Inmodern agriculture avoiding chemical fertilizers completely is not possible, butthere is every need to focus on the management aspects and new interventions tosupplement a part of the chemical nutrient source. The outcome of new technologies

"will be more effective if it is designed to increase the ef ﬁciency of rhizosphere.
Rhizospheric microbes play a major role in complex interactions and nutrientcycling at root zone. The best intervention to supplement a part of energy and tomanipulate rhizospheric microclimate is seed bio-priming which is an ecocentric anduser friendly technique. Seed biopriming enables better plant performance evenunder adverse conditions, improves nutrient uptake and resists the plant againstbiotic and abiotic stress conditions. In current scenario, there is growing attentiontowards bene ﬁcial microorganisms to get higher quality and quantity of economic
yields and has incredible scope in near future.

Abstract Nitrogen is an essential and incredibly versatile element for living organ-
isms. In agriculture, nitrogen is a key element to understand soil and aquatic pollu-
tion, very often associated with heavy metal pollution. In this chapter, we overview
the correlations between nitrogen and copper pollution, mediated by antimicrobial
compounds used in agriculture. Plant Growth-Promoting Microorganisms (PGPM)
are a heterogeneous group of microorganisms ranging from Bacteria (PGPBs) to
Archaea and Fungi, which can modulate plant growth by conferring direct and

12.1 Plant Growth-Promoting Bacteria
Nitrogen is a fundamental element for all living beings, for its participation in theconstitution of amino acids, nucleotides, and other compounds essential to life. For
this reason, it can limit plant growth as much as water availability (Malavolta 2006 ).
Bacteria can improve the acquisition of nutrients through biofertilization , which
means providing nutrients for plants through natural processes, rather than chemicalfertilizers. The biological nitrogen ﬁxation (BNF) is a biofertilization process better",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,250
"means providing nutrients for plants through natural processes, rather than chemicalfertilizers. The biological nitrogen ﬁxation (BNF) is a biofertilization process better
understood in comparison to others, like nutrient solubilization (Weselowski et al.2016 ; Schütz et al. 2018 ; Przemieniecki et al. 2019 ).
Theﬁrst discoveries of nitrogen- ﬁxing bacteria were reported at the end of the
nineteenth century by Beijerinck ( 1888 ), who explained that the BNF process is
carried out by bacteria, which he named Bacillus radicicola . Later, the genus
Rhizobium was proposed by Frank ( 1889 ) for nitrogen- ﬁxing bacteria present in
the nodules of leguminous roots. In Brazil, Johanna Döbereiner started her careerdeveloping research to elucidate the ability of native pastures to remain greenwithout nitrogen supplementation and still succeed in sugarcane ﬁelds. In the late
1950s, Dr. Döbereiner isolated the diazotrophic bacteria Azotobacter paspali",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,250
"1950s, Dr. Döbereiner isolated the diazotrophic bacteria Azotobacter paspali
(Döbereiner 1966 ) and Beijerinckia ﬂuminensis (Döbereiner and Ruschel 1958 ),
starting a legacy of biofertilizers in South America.
Nitrogen- ﬁxing bacteria (diazotrophs) can transform atmospheric nitrogen (N2),
which is not assimilated by plants, into ammonia (NH3) through the nitrogenaseenzyme complex, not only making this nutrient available to plants (Newton 2000 )
but also keeping the biogeochemical nitrogen cycle a ﬂoat. When living inside plant
tissues, some types of bacteria establish a symbiotic association with leguminousplants forming nodules (Gupta et al. 2015 ) that facilitate nitrogen assimilation
through BNF. However, the richest niche for bacteria is the plant-soil system, inwhich they can form complex communities and dynamic interactions with the
rhizosphere —the region of the soil where microbe-mediated processes are more",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,250
"rhizosphere —the region of the soil where microbe-mediated processes are more
heavily in ﬂuenced by the root system, considering the release of a wide variety of
compounds that attract organisms through the roots of plants (Rab et al. 2016 ).
Bacteria associated with plants are classi ﬁed according to the proximity and
intimacy with the root system, as free-living (while not attracted to the root exu-
dates); rhizospheric, living in the zone around the surface of the root (bene ﬁting from250 G. P. B. Mothé et al.",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,250
"the released exudates); epiphytic orassociative bacteria, colonizing the rhizoplane;
orﬁnally as endophytic bacteria, which colonize tissues internally without causing
damage, being symbiotic with the host plant or not (Figueiredo et al. 2010 ; Souza
et al. 2015 ).
Besides improving plant nutrient uptake, bene ﬁcial bacteria might also be able to
protect the host against biotic and abiotic stresses. Thus, bene ﬁcial bacteria might,
directly and indirectly, promote plant growth, thus named plant growth-promoting
bacteria (PGPBs) (Jian et al. 2019 ). PGPB can provide growth-promoting bene ﬁts
directly, by synthesizing phytohormones (auxins, cytokinins, and gibberellins),
siderophores , the enzyme ACC deaminase (which reduces ethylene levels in plants);
and solubilize minerals such as phosphorus and zinc, making those nutrients more
readily available for plant growth. They can also perform ecosystemic services such",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,251
"and solubilize minerals such as phosphorus and zinc, making those nutrients more
readily available for plant growth. They can also perform ecosystemic services such
as providing nitrate, oxidation of sulfur, and increased permeability of the roots. Theindirect promotion of plant growth by PGPB occurs mainly by antagonism topathogenic microorganisms, in which the competition for space and nutrientsinduces the production of antibiotics, bacteriocins, lytic enzymes, and hydrocyanicacid, which might also induce systemic resistance in the plant (Glick 2012 ; dos
Santos Silva et al. 2019 ). In the next paragraphs, we will further describe these
ecosystemic services while drawing the role of nitrogen in those processes.
Phosphorus (P) is the second most required element in plant nutrition, second
only to nitrogen (Raij 1991 ), being fundamental for practically all plant metabolism,",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,251
"Phosphorus (P) is the second most required element in plant nutrition, second
only to nitrogen (Raij 1991 ), being fundamental for practically all plant metabolism,
participating in energy transfers, photosynthesis, respiration, synthesis of nucleicacids, among others (Santoyo et al. 2016 ). Phosphate solubilizing bacteria solubilize
inorganic forms of phosphate as a consequence of the release of organic acids intothe medium, changing the pH and increasing the availability of phosphorus for thehost plant (Silva 2019a ). Nitrogen sources preferred for phosphate solubilization in
bacteria seem to be related to the stage of BNF for which that microorganism is
specialized. For example, Pallavi and Gupta ( 2013 ) found nitrate to be a more
efﬁcient source of N in vitro for phosphate solubilization in Pseudomonas lurida .",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,251
"specialized. For example, Pallavi and Gupta ( 2013 ) found nitrate to be a more
efﬁcient source of N in vitro for phosphate solubilization in Pseudomonas lurida .
However, the authors mentioned that different studies point to ammonia compoundsas a preferred source, likely by ammonia oxidizers. This pattern was describedearlier in fungi, where nitrate is preferred over ammonium (Reyes et al. 1999 ;
Seshadri et al. 2004 ). It is also important to note that phosphate solubilization and
other growth-promotion traits do not exist with the intention of promoting plant
growth, but prioritize the microbe ’s metabolism, with “leftover ”soluble phosphate
in the environment, which is then available to the plant (Yandigeri et al. 2011 ). Other
traits which have no clear function in the microorganism metabolism can also betreated as a competitive advantage over other microorganisms, rather than causality.
Similarly, bacteria synthesize siderophores, which are molecules with a high",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,251
"Similarly, bacteria synthesize siderophores, which are molecules with a high
afﬁnity for Fe+3, as well as membrane receptors capable of binding to the Fe –
siderophore complex, thus facilitating the absorption of iron by microorganisms andplants, bringing the direct bene ﬁts of siderophores to the bacterial-mediated growth
of plants (Saha et al. 2016 ). Although iron is the fourth most abundant element on
Earth, in aerobic soils, iron is not easily assimilated by bacteria or plants (Galvão
2010 ). The enzymes nitrogenase, leghemoglobin, ferredoxin, and hydrogenase,12 Overview of the Role of Nitrogen in Copper Pollution and Bioremediation ... 251",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,251
"which are required for BNF, are all dependent on iron. Thus, nodulated legumes
have an increased demand for iron compared to plants that do not form nodules.Even though iron is not essential to nodulation, some studies reviewed by Khan et al.
(2017 ) show that siderophore-producing bacteria have a better performance of BNF
in nodules than siderophore-mutants.
Another mechanism for the promotion of plant growth is phytostimulation ,
resulting from the production of phytohormones by microorganisms. These arechemical regulators that trigger speci ﬁc actions in varied functions in the develop-
ment of plants (Gupta et al. 2015 ). Indoleacetic acid (a type of auxin) regulates cell
division and elongation of the roots providing greater absorption of water andnutrients from the soil for the plant (Taiz and Zeiger 2013 ) and it is known to be
positively associated with higher N ﬁxation, even though this is still poorly under-",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,252
"positively associated with higher N ﬁxation, even though this is still poorly under-
stood (Keyeo et al. 2011 ). Gibberellins determine important physiological changes
in plants, interfere with ﬂowering, sexual expression, senescence, abscission, ger-
mination, breaking dormancy, while cytokinins stimulate cell division (cytokinesis)and the development of lateral buds (Glick 2012 ). The effect of N on production and
regulation of phytohormones is better described in algae (valued for biofuel produc-tion), where the addition of phytohormones (in those studies, not produced byPGPB) stabilizes algal growth under N starvation or depletion, even though these
exogenous phytohormones could not protect the algae against reactive oxygen
species (ROS) (Yu et al. 2018 ; Renuka et al. 2018 ; Chokshi et al. 2017 ), which is",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,252
"exogenous phytohormones could not protect the algae against reactive oxygen
species (ROS) (Yu et al. 2018 ; Renuka et al. 2018 ; Chokshi et al. 2017 ), which is
one of the functions provided by PGPB. Nonetheless, it is also worth noting that inagricultural settings, low-nitrogen water bodies are rare. A much more commonsituation is the occurrence of hypoxic, high-nutrient water bodies, caused by theirresponsible use of fertilizers. Macrophytes thrive in low-oxygen aquatic environ-ments over aerated setups (Wang et al. 2020 ), nonetheless, the nutrient discharge
destabilizes the growth of those plants making shallow eutrophic water bodies more
susceptible to algal blooms (Bakker et al. 2010 ).
Biocontrol is considered an indirect plant promotion mechanism consisting of the

Iron competition, for example, inhibits the growth of potentially harmful microor-ganisms when PGPB has better advantages for iron assimilation (Pérez-Montañoet al. 2014 ). Similarly, the competition for nitrogen is an important regulator of
success for microbial colonization.

wetlands wastewater treatment, in which the depuration is mainly carried out byplant and microbial processes (Vymazal 2011 ).
Studies on PGPB concerning aquatic environments are still little explored if
compared to terrestrial environments. Macrophytes are plants that indicate waterquality and are used for environmental monitoring (Sood et al. 2012 ), and the growth
of some species potential can be used to remove or minimize the incidence of excessnutrients or control eutrophication in water (Kraft et al. 2014 ), while others are
sensitive to eutrophication (Bakker et al. 2010 ).Acinetobacter calcoaceticus was

12.2 Copper Resistance in Bacteria
Another characteristic of some PGPB species is the ability to tolerate a highconcentration of toxic metals and still maintain their growth-promotion traits.
These bacteria are good candidates for the bioremediation of contaminants of soil
and water bodies through their mutual interactions with plants, which increases plantproductivity (de Andrade et al. 2019 ). Copper (Cu), when in excess, is one of these
toxic metals. As an element necessary for correct metabolism functioning, it isclassi ﬁed as an essential micronutrient for organisms (in concentrations below",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,253

interfering with the absorption of iron and other nutrients, in addition to decreasing
soil fertility (Lamichhane et al. 2018 ).
Copper resistance is an important natural selection mechanism, in ﬂuencing the
evolution dynamics of soil bacterial communities. Since the concentration of copperhas increased in several bacterial habitats due to anthropogenic processes, it ispossible to ﬁnd resistant bacteria in these sites. This ability allows bacteria with12 Overview of the Role of Nitrogen in Copper Pollution and Bioremediation ... 253",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,253

Lamichhane et al. ( 2018 ) review various studies in which resistant bacterial
isolates and communities are selected in the environment due to the presence of
anthropic copper sources such as pesticide use through copper-based antimicrobial
compounds (CBAC), animal supplementation, industrial activities, and copper min-
ing. A widely studied bacterial genus is Cupriavidus , which possesses several
mechanisms of resistance to toxic metals, thriving in environments with highconcentrations of copper. Cupriavidus metallidurans (isolated from freshwater)
and Cupriavidus gilardii (isolated from soils and plants contaminated by toxic
metals) are resistant to high concentrations of copper, presenting high complexity
in their homeostasis mechanisms (Huang et al. 2019 ).
Different studies also describe the effects of copper contamination on microbial",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,254
"in their homeostasis mechanisms (Huang et al. 2019 ).
Different studies also describe the effects of copper contamination on microbial
communities in the ﬁeld. The use of the aforementioned CBAC, such as the
Bordeaux mixture, its Brazilian derivative Viçosa mixture (in Portuguese Calda
Viçosa ), and the Burgundy mixture is the greatest source of copper contamination in
agricultural soil (Lamichhane et al., 2018 ) (Table 12.1). Even though those mixtures
were initially thought of as fungicides in vineyards, they have been largely applied inother cultivations, using different application methods (Fig. 12.1).
Copper and other metals might reach the microbial cell through a chemiosmotic
gradient of the cytoplasmic membrane (passive transport) or hydrolysis of ATP(active transport). Resistance mechanisms are mainly based on maintaining theintracellular level of the metal ion well controlled. The uptake and ef ﬂux of ions",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,254
"by the microbial cell occurring through active transport by ATPases prevent theexcess and accumulation of ions (Boechat et al. 2017 ). As other micronutrients,
copper is used as a catalytic and structural cofactor of biochemical processes in theformation of metalloenzymes such as superoxide dismutase (antioxidant defense)
and cytochrome C oxidase (electron transport chain), however in excess, copper
induces the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), causing damage to nucleicacids, lipids, and proteins (Avanzi et al. 2017 ).
Bacteria such as Pseudomonas ﬂuorescens andPseudomonas putida are exam-
ples of PGPB that can act as bioremediators in contaminated environments andpromote the concomitant growth of plants in places contaminated by copper (Gutiér-rez-Barranquero et al. 2013 ; Xing et al. 2020 ). That is possible through the selection

Basically, in Gram-positive bacteria, a cytoplasmic reductase reduces Cu2+ to
Cu+, which can be absorbed by ATPase CopA (Fig. 12.2a ). The excess copper binds
to CopZ, and then is donated to the CopY, to stimulate transcription of the copoperon. In conditions of low copper content, CopY forms dimers and binds to zinc.When CopZ donates Cu + to CopY, each Zn2+ in each CopY monomer is replaced
by two Cu + ions, with the concomitant release of CopY from the promoter allowing

"12.3 Bioremediation of Copper and Promotion of Plant
Growth
Pollution of soil and aquatic systems by copper is a factor that affects the quality of
the environment and constitutes an imminent risk of poisoning to humans. Anthropicactions are responsible for adding 1.16 million tons of toxic metals per year toterrestrial and aquatic ecosystems worldwide (EPA 2007 ) including mining and
mining waste areas, sewage sludge, pig slurry, industrial waste, and viniculture(Sharma et al. 2015 ; Srivastava et al. 2015 ) causing the availability of metals in
the environment at high levels (Wu et al. 2016 ). In agriculture, the use of toxic metal-
based antimicrobials for disease control in crops leads to the accumulation of metals
in the soil (La Torre et al. 2018 ). For copper, those compounds, such as the Bordeaux",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,257
"based antimicrobials for disease control in crops leads to the accumulation of metals
in the soil (La Torre et al. 2018 ). For copper, those compounds, such as the Bordeaux
and Burgundy mixtures are still widely applied, for their advantages such asrelatively low toxicity to plants, low cost, and apparent low toxicity to mammals.It has led, however, to the widespread use of copper in the management of plantdiseases since the last century (Lamichhane et al. 2018 ).
Considering the toxicity of copper to microorganisms, it is hypothesized that a
high concentration of the metal would affect microbial metabolism, including thegrowth-promotion traits. Few studies, however, associate growth-promotion mech-

"anisms and resistance to copper in bacteria. The sequestration of metals in bacteria
and plants can be performed by different mechanisms, such as biosorption, biomin-eralization, bioassimilation, biosurfactants, and production of enzymes that act in theprocess of reducing or oxidizing the metal to less toxic forms (Andreazza et al.2013 ). Forward, we will further analyze some of those properties, and how they
relate to the biogeochemical cycle of nitrogen.
In general, copper in small amounts positively affects the nitrogen metabolism by
increasing levels of ammonia and nitrate (Zhang et al. 2014 ), photosynthesis,
respiration, and nutrient uptake (Laporte et al. 2020 ). On the other hand, higher",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,257
"increasing levels of ammonia and nitrate (Zhang et al. 2014 ), photosynthesis,
respiration, and nutrient uptake (Laporte et al. 2020 ). On the other hand, higher
concentrations of this metal induce modulation in enzymes related to nitrogenmetabolisms, such as NADH-glutamate dehydrogenase, NAD-glutamate dehydro-genase, alanine aminotransferase, and aspartate aminotransferase, to alleviate stress.Even though bacteria are also affected by copper stress (Ouyang et al. 2016 ), PGPB
might help further reduce this stress when associated with plants (Li et al. 2014b ).
The bioremediation via “biosorption ”includes both absorbing (i.e. bringing into
the tissues or cells) or adsorbing (immobilizing on the surface of tissues or cells),
and can be performed both by plants and associative microbiota, including cases in
which endophytes increased the plant tolerance to toxic metals (Shen et al. 2013 ).",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,257
"and can be performed both by plants and associative microbiota, including cases in
which endophytes increased the plant tolerance to toxic metals (Shen et al. 2013 ).
Nonetheless, it is worth noting that although in different levels for different plantspecies, toxic metal absorption is a common plant trait, and include species ofeconomical relevance, such as tomato, maize, and cabbage (An et al. 2011 ), which
highlights the importance of bioremediation in metal-polluted areas, considering thethreat that metal accumulation in cultures pose to human and animal health. As foradsorption, plant-microbe-mediated remediation stands as a natural alternative to
carbon nanotubes and graphene (Xu et al. 2018 ) and the biopolymer chitosan (Ngah12 Overview of the Role of Nitrogen in Copper Pollution and Bioremediation ... 257",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,257
"et al. 2011 ), both of which seek to adsorb pollutants on their surface, with posterior
removal of carbon compounds with adsorbed metal from that environment.
Biomineralization is a common metabolism in many plant species, in which they
create calcium oxalate, calcium carbonate, or silicon crystals in their tissues.
Described functions for those crystals range from osmotic regulation to protectionagainst herbivores, and also includes remediation of toxic metals. Even though theliterature for copper biomineralization in plants is scarce, He et al. ( 2014 ) review
studies describing the incorporation of this metal, and also aluminum, strontium,cadmium, and other metals into the plant ’s silicon crystals. The biomineralization of
copper is better described, however, in microorganisms, including bacterial speciesRahnella sp. (Zhao et al. 2019 ) and Kocuria ﬂava(Kaur et al. 2015 ), and the fungus

"Penicillium ochrochloron (Crusberg 2013 ). Moreover, the effect of nitrogen sources
in the biomineralization of copper is better described in fungi, as seen in Fominaet al. ( 2017 ), which described ammonia as a source of inorganic nitrogen that
induced a seven-fold increase in copper immobilization in malachite crystals, incomparison to nitrate. Liu et al. ( 2019 ) describe the role of nitrogen in biomineral-
ization through organic structures. According to his research, L-glutamic acidsupplementation yielded larger copper carbonate particles and stabilized their struc-tures in the early stages. Similarly, Zhang et al. ( 2014 ) described a stimulation in the
activity of glutamine synthetase and glutamate synthetase in Luffa cylindrica.

The soil microbial communities are involved in many key functions that include
nutrient cycling, and sustaining plant growth. These functions can be threatened bypoor agricultural practices and climate change. Some key cycles that are crucial inmaintaining soil well-being are the C and N cycles that can be easily affected by soildegradation and climate change (Amundson et al. 2015 ). However, the knowledge

In this chapter we will focus on the main issue soil microbiologists face, which is
understanding the soil energy cycles that are fueled by soil microbes. Soil microor-
ganisms together with the plants determine the below ground cycles and control thegasses released into the environment as well as the exudates released into the soil(Crowther et al. 2016 ). The microbial populations and the environment largely

opens up opportunities for us to identify the major microbial networks within the
soil and to advance soil microbiome research to provide opportunities to comman-
deer metabolic interactions in the soil and for prospecting of organisms that may beutilized in industries in producing novel byproducts such as antibiotics, and biofuelsand for use in the agricultural industry (Ling et al. 2015 ). From the various studies
that have been conducted on soil microbial content, it has been reported that therhizospheric region of the soil, especially is in ﬂuenced by root exudates, which

13.2 Importance of Studying Soil Microbiome
The global population will increase in the next few decades leading to an increase indemand for food. FAO has predicted that by the year 2050 that the population will beabout 10 billion in size and our food demands will be up by 70%. Therefore, there isa need to move agriculture in the direction of sustainable agriculture withdiminishing resources and the exasperating effects of climate change (Tian et al.2016 ; Sergaki et al. 2018 ). The current anthropogenic activities in ﬂuence the

order to keep up with the demands for food it is important for us to adopt intensi ﬁed
and sustainable agriculture to produce more food with the limitations on resourcesand climate change (Chowdhary et al. 2018 ). Climate change has its impact on the
macro and micropopulation (Sergaki et al. 2018 ). Climatic changes such as temper-
ature ﬂuctuations, ﬂooding, and drought signi ﬁcantly affect the functional activity in
the plant-soil-microbe equation (Bojko and Kabala 2017 ). These climatic changes
result in variation in community structures, soil community taxa, relative abundance
and the overall microbial density in response to the environment (Hashem et al.
2018 ). It has been postulated that the changes to soils environments such as",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,268
"and the overall microbial density in response to the environment (Hashem et al.
2018 ). It has been postulated that the changes to soils environments such as
temperature, oxygen, and water content affect the microbial population just asmuch as the interaction between the root exudates and the soil environment. Thesefactors play a crucial role in shaping the microbial communities below ground,where these change to the ecosystems will result in structural and compositionalchanges that affects the soil health and fertility (Schimel and Schaeffer 2012 ). It is
therefore important for us to acknowledge that soil microbial communities are
important, especially in the agricultural front and therefore studies into the soil
population dynamics need to be intensi ﬁed to support the sustainable intensi ﬁcation
of agriculture (Hameed et al. 2014 ).

13.3 The Dif ﬁculty in Studying Soil Microorganisms
Soil heterogeneity poses a challenge for microbiologist to study the community and
microbial composition. Further, the soil chemical and physical structure varies in
formation (Girvan et al. 2003 ). Beyond the variations observed in the soil matrix, the
soil microbial communities vary based on environmental changes such as nutrientcontent, moisture, and temperature (Nunan et al. 2002 ). Therefore, it is hard for us to
make comparisons between reports made by various researchers as the method ofsampling used may vary giving very different representation of the soils populationdynamics. We have to be aware that the microbial communities may be nested in13 Metagenomics for Improving Soil Fertility 269",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,268
"various levels or communities depending on soil properties, depth, and sampling
techniques, among other parameters. This results in microsites that provide variationin data and results in gross misrepresentation of information when we neglect to take
these variations into account when studying the soil dynamics. Hence it is important
for us to determine the sampling technique and sampling size as both these param-eters affect the identi ﬁcation of microbial diversity and function. Over the years
various methods have been employed but in the late 1990s Klironomos suggested acombination of techniques, which would provide a better representation of themicrobial population by reducing the error in sampling regime (Klironomos et al.1999 ; Fujisawa et al. 2015 ).
Obstacles towards studying the soil microbial population are due to the inability

predictions that the soil contains about 10",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,269
"to culture and study all these organisms. It has been postulated through mathematical
predictions that the soil contains about 10
7prokaryotic cells in a gram of soil (Gans
et al. 2005 ). This of course does not take into account the several unculturability
microorganisms, which cannot be studied due to the lack of understanding on theirphysiology and cultivable needs. Further, these inabilities to culture these organismsmay also be a result in phenotypic and genetical differences that make theseorganisms different from the 1% population that is easily cultivated in the laboratoryand may most likely be the minority of soil population as the unknown may form the
larger population (Stewart 2012 ). The mathematical modeling to determine the
population diversity in the soil is largely bias and a large number of soil sampleswill be required to provide suf ﬁcient information of the estimates (Curtis and Sloan

As one major issue lies in the identi ﬁcation of non-culturable organisms, there-
fore methods that are culture-independent such as DNA- and RNA-based techniqueshave become a commonplace (Kowalchuk et al. 2004 ; Jacoby et al. 2017 ). Identi-
ﬁcation methods using 16S, 18S, and ITS regions of organisms have contributed
signiﬁcantly in identi ﬁcation of prokaryotes and eukaryotes and have de ﬁned organ-
isms to taxonomic groups based on sequence information. These techniques havegone through vigorous modi ﬁcations yielding towards metagenomics, which allows

throughput sequencing (HTS) or next-generation sequencing (NGS). HTS wouldinclude platforms such as 454 Genome Sequencer, HiSeq, MiSeq, PacBio, and theAB SOLiD (Rincon-Florez et al. 2016 ; Yergeau et al. 2014 ). By utilizing these
platforms it would be easier and achievable to identify the functional versatility,diversity of the microbiome, and diversity based on niches through the study ofmetagenomics and metatranscriptomics (Escobar-Zepeda et al. 2015 ; Oulas et al.

"13.4 Microbes in Soil Health and Fertility
In the recent years, soil health has become an important area to study as any
disturbances to surface and internal soil pro ﬁle and content. One important compo-
nent of soil health is the microbial biodiversity in the soil. In recent years thesuccessful application of microbes to the soil has become crucial in maintainingsoil health and fertility. In addition microbial content has been implicated in improv-ing water-holding capacity, carbon storage, improved root growth, nutrient cycling,bioremediation, and conservation of soil biodiversity (Keesstra et al. 2012 ; Lal 2016 ;
Jacoby et al. 2017 ). Many research groups have focused their studies on soil
beneﬁcial microbes that can contribute towards improved yield, biotic, and abiotic
stress management. These bene ﬁcial microbes are able to provide long-term solu-
tions in the area of improved growth, disease management, and also in the manage-ment of abiotic stresses (Bargaz et al. 2018 ).",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,270

The soil microbes form the organic component of the soil where it is involved in
supplying nutrients and protection against biotic and abiotic stresses. However, ouragricultural practices have resulted in the depletion of microbes in the soil throughthe extensive use of agro-chemicals (Amundson et al. 2015 ). These chemicals cause
soil degradation, eutrophication, and greenhouse gas emissions (Steffen et al. 2015 ).
This therefore requires an alternative that is not detrimental to soil health and fertilityand reduces the reliance on agrochemical inputs (Foley et al. 2011 ). Therefore, we
need microbes that are bene ﬁcial that not only improve and protect the plants but will
also protect the environment against the detrimental effects of toxic compounds inthe soil from our practices. These microbes also assist in the utilization of speci ﬁc",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,270

Factors contributing to better soil health and well-being such as agro-ecological

agricultural practices. Enriching soil microbial communities must take into consid-
eration the presence, abundance, and diversity of microorganisms and their proposed
contribution to soil health and fertility and suitability as bioindicators (Lu et al.2014 ). Various groups such as bacteria, fungi, and AM fungi play a crucial role in
the nutrient management of plant –soil interactions (Cavagnaro et al. 2015 ; Kumar
et al. 2015 ). These organisms are responsible for the management of energy and
nutrient acquisition and utilization by plants. Their role in sustainable agriculturalpractices is crucial in ensuring better yields and protection from stresses. This wouldrequire a concerted effort from multidiscipline such as ecology, agronomy, soil
science, genetics, economics, and social sciences (Kumar et al. 2016 ).13 Metagenomics for Improving Soil Fertility 271",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,270
"13.5 Emerging Technologies in Microbial Population
Studies
There are various molecular techniques that have been used previously to identify
the soil microbial diversity and structure. These include techniques such as Phos-pholipid Fatty Acid Analysis (PLFA), Terminal Restriction Fragment Length Poly-morphism (TRFLP), Ampli ﬁed Ribosomal DNA Restriction Analysis (ARISA),
ampli ﬁed rDNA restriction analysis (ARDRA), single strand conformation poly-
morphism (SSCP), denaturing/temperature gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE/TGGE), Random Ampli ﬁcation of Polymorphic DNA (RAPD), Ampli ﬁcation Frag-

microbial composition in any studied sample, it does not provide a very goodrepresentation of the shifts in the microbial population relative to changes inenvironment (Nemergut et al. 2013 ). With the advent of genomics, transcriptomics,
proteomics, and metabolomics, researchers are able to understand the diversity andfunctional shift of the microorganisms in the soil. All this has been made possiblethrough the high-throughput sequencing platforms that are available in the past

"decades (Hugerth and Andersson 2017 ; Malla et al. 2018 ). With more techniques
becoming available, the researcher has to be selective of the method that best serveshis or her research needs. The most commonly used technique to date to identifytaxonomic groups in the soil is the amplicon sequencing technique that enables thecharacterization of the bacterial composition within a given ecosystem (Malla et al.2018 ). While the amplicon sequencing technique provides a large amount of infor-
mation, this technique provides no information on the functionality of the species orcommunities (Gupta et al. 2019 ). This shortfall in the amplicon strategy has resulted
in the application of the shotgun metagenomics platform to better understand the
composition, diversity and functionality of the given communities. While the shot-gun sequencing technique provides the functional potential of the communities but itlacks the depth associated with amplicon sequencing (Zhou et al. 2015 ). While we",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,271
"choose which technology to use what seem most important and relevant to date is thesampling technique used to ensure that we get the best representation of the microbeswithin the soil aggregates studied (Lombard et al. 2011 ). In addition to what
platforms to use to understand the microbial communities, it would be important
for large datasets to be generated to ensure that a good representation of the site of
study is obtained (Zhou et al. 2015 ). To support the sequencing technologies that
have been developed several bioinformatics pipelines have been established to assistwith the analyses of the large datasets that have been obtained. Pipelines such asMEGAN, MG-RAST, QIIME, and MOTHUR have been utilized to analyze thedatasets in various organisms (Oulas et al. 2015 ; Plummer et al. 2015 ; Barthi and

"13.6 Metagenomics as a Means to Unlock the Unknown
As mentioned in earlier segments, soil microbes are able to contribute towards
improved agricultural practices (Bender et al. 2016 ). Therefore it is important to
build up microbial associations that are able to maximize bene ﬁts and environmental
restoration in meeting global climate change challenges (Lau et al. 2017 ). In any
ecosystem microbial communities contribute towards the energy, nutrient, and thegaseous emissions (Deemer et al. 2016 ). These microbial communities have been
traditionally divided into decomposers, pathogens, and symbionts (Baldrian 2017 ).

Shakya et al. 2019 ).
To begin the exploration of the soil microbiota it will require the extraction of the

For further details on soil DNA extraction strategies andenrichment processes, several kits and methods have been compared and informa-tion provided in detail through manuals and articles (Haruta and Kanno 2015 ;
Emerson et al. 2017 ).
Once the DNA is obtained the next step would be to construct the soil libraries.
This would require the cloning of the extracted DNA into suitable vectors. The
choice of vector is strongly dependent on the objective of the experiment. For13 Metagenomics for Improving Soil Fertility 273",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,272
"instance, if the DNA is being used for PCR, then the DNA yield is more critical than
the vector, but if the sample is to be deposited in the gene bank, then the selection ofvector is crucial as you would have to select vectors that can take large DNA
fragments to reduce the number of clones needed to provide complete coverage.
Generally, most vectors are cloned into Escherichia coli host cells for construction
of a metagenome library. When larger fragments are involved vectors such ascosmid, fosmid (for less than 40 kb), and BAC (more than 40 kb) have been utilized.In certain studies, where the soil samples were surveyed for bioactive compounds,other host strains have been utilized such as Rhizobium leguminosarum ,Streptomy-

identifying genes in E. coli host system. This has resulted in researchers looking for
alternative host systems that will provide for better gene identi ﬁcation. Some
examples of these systems are METREX and SIGEX, which are novel strains thatwere developed to improve high-throughput screenings in metagenomics (Yun and

The metagenome libraries can also be analyzed with the microarray technology toprovide information of the composition and the complexity of the microbial com-munities. However, this technique has been shown to be less sensitive then the PCRbased detection strategy and is rather costly (Sebat et al. 2003 ; Zhou and Thompson
2002 ). While we have technologies that are being constantly updated to provide
access to enormous amounts of microbial sequence data, these technologies are still
not able to cope with complex soil communities as these techniques still do notprovide an in-depth coverage of the microbial communities within (Escobar-Zepedaet al. 2015 ; Nayfach and Pollard 2016 ; Malla et al. 2018 ).

Compared to other genome studies such as human, animals, and isolated organisms,
the soil microbiota still remains rudimentary and constitutes a huge and ambitiouschallenge. Further, with the enormous amount of information obtained from thevarious genome sequencing projects worldwide, it is important that this informationis shared publicly and among scienti ﬁc communities. To ensure that the quality of
information that is being fed into these online resources meet the standards, the openaccess information through international working bodies have established the Geno-mic Standards Consortium (GSC) ( http://gensc.org/gc_wiki/index.php/GSC ) that",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,273

one critical challenge lies in the assembly of the sequences into scaffolds. This is

14.1 Introduction
Environmental soil degradation with long-term continuous cropping involving uti-
lization of chemical fertilizers leads to the imbalance or reduction in nutrient
availability and fertility of soil (Dong et al. 2012 ). The management of soil to ensure
its long-term productivity, stability, and fertility is of paramount importance for plant
growth. The maintenance of the physical and chemical soil fertility is driven by the
metabolic repertoire of the soil microorganisms (Sabale et al. 2019 ). The soil
biological fertility relies on the microbial community, which is termed as the

"indicators of soil health that directly impacts the functioning of soil ecosystem. Thus,
the soil health comprises biological, chemical, and physical properties of soil but ismostly dependent on the activity of microorganisms. The biological measurement of
soil health can be inferred from certain robust indicators (e.g. microbial diversity,
enzyme activity, and soil organic matter content) that can provide instant informa-tion about the current status of soil (Rincon-Florez et al. 2013 ). Among different soil
health indicators, there is increased concern in studying soil microorganisms in theirspeciﬁc environments, as microbial diversity is closely linked to soil structure and
function. Moreover, soil microorganisms rapidly respond to any kind perturbations(Jacoby et al. 2017 ).

"14.2 Soil Microbiome
The soil microbiome is indispensable as it performs key soil services including
organic matter decomposition, biogeochemical cycling, aggregates formation, gas-eous exchange, and plant growth promotion (Christopher 2017 ; Naylor et al. 2020 ).
The soil represents the most diverse habitats consisting complex assemblages ofbacteria, archaea, viruses, fungi, and other microbial eukaryotes which are collec-tively referred as the “soil microbiome ”(Fierer 2017 ; Jansson and Hofmockel 2020 ).
The estimate suggests 1000 –10,000 bacterial species in per gram of agricultural soils
as inferred from the 16S rRNA gene phylotypes (Attwood et al. 2019 ). The reservoir
of microbial communities in soil improves plant growth by affecting nutrients
availability, aids in crop residue recycling along with determination ofagroecosystems productivity (Van-Der Heijden et al. 2008 ). The sustainable agri-
culture depends on the diversity of soil microbes that in ﬂuences soil fertility.",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,283
"culture depends on the diversity of soil microbes that in ﬂuences soil fertility.
Therefore, the present day research focuses more in managing soil microbiome(Dubey et al. 2019 ).
The characterization and classi ﬁcation of soil microbiome by typical cultivation
approaches (plate count and most probable number) have underestimated the micro-
bial diversity as largest proportion of soil bacteria still remain uncharacterized
(Dupont et al. 2016 ). The majority of the soil isolated microbes belonged to the

severe constraints in isolation methods, there is need for switching to the molecularand genetic level approaches that will unearth more comprehensive picture of soilmicrobiome by discovering new microbial players through in-depth characterization(Agrawal et al. 2015 ; Sabale et al. 2019 ). During the last few years, signi ﬁcant
improvement has been seen in the development of certain biomarkers and macro-
molecular probes, rapid and reliable measurements of soil microbial communities(Arias et al. 2005 ). The measurement of microbial diversity can be classi ﬁed into

their potential to differentiate among various types of soils and their signi ﬁcance in
the ecosystem. The current molecular strategies have led to the discovery of unusualmicrobial diversity, majority of which was uncharacterized so far because ofnon-culturable nature (Agrawal et al. 2015 ). Molecular techniques to determine
microbial diversity in soil can be categorized into PCR-dependent andPCR-independent techniques. Nucleic acid re-association/hybridization, carbonsource utilization pro ﬁle/community level, physiological pro ﬁle (CLPP)/BIOLOG,

"fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) analysis, phospholipids fatty acid (PLFA) analysis
are PCR-independent approaches used for measuring microbial communities. Someof the limitations of the aforementioned techniques include dominance of culturablecommunity and preferring microbes that can utilize the available carbon sources.These methods mainly signify metabolic diversity rather than microbial diversity(Fakruddin and Mannan 2013 ).
14.4 PCR-Based Approaches
The initial molecular approach for investigating biological community depends on
the cloning of target genes isolated from environmental samples (DeSantis et al.2007 ). Majority of the genetic ﬁngerprinting techniques relies on PCR ampli ﬁcation
which provides information regarding the genetic makeup of microbes. The pro-karyotic diversity, identi ﬁcation, and phylogenetic relationships are provided by

"PCR-based 16S rDNA pro ﬁle. PCR-based ﬁngerprinting methods of microbial
communities involves the extraction of DNA from a culture, a bioreactor, or an
environmental sample, followed by the ampli ﬁcation of rRNA/rDNA using the
Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR), and ﬁnally an analysis of the DNA ampli ﬁcation
products (Ngom and Liu 2014 ). The PCR-based approaches are distributed into two
groups depending on the differential electrophoretic migration on agarose or poly-acrylamide gels: (1) size-dependent migration, viz. T-RFLP, ARISA/RISA, RAPD,14 Soil Microbial Diversity and Metagenomics 285",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,284
"SSCP, LH-PCR and (2) sequence-dependent migration which includes denaturing
gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and temperature gradient gel electrophoresis(TGGE). In all the above-mentioned techniques, community structure of microbial
populations can be evaluated from the ampli ﬁed fragments generated by selected
primers. Thus, 16S rDNA-based PCR techniques such as DGGE, TGGE, single-strand conformation polymorphisms (SSCPs), ampli ﬁed ribosomal DNA restriction
analysis (ARDRA), terminal restriction fragment length polymorphisms (T-RFLPs),and ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis (RISA) offer comprehensive informationregarding community richness, evenness, and composition present in a sample(Rawat and Johri 2014 ). All the PCR-based techniques are suitable for tracing the

ampli ﬁcation of shorter fragments comprising weaker secondary structures (Rincon-

low-throughput, PCR biased and prefer easily extractable DNA that usually leads toconfusing and unsuitable results. Further, microarrays have also been developedwith already known gene sequences from public databases with regular updating ofnew gene and genome sequences. But, the application of this technology forreviewing environmental sample still presents numerous limitations (He et al.2012 ; Ngom and Liu 2014 ). Thus, to avoid the hindrance in evaluation of soil
microbial communities, metagenomics combined with bioinformatics have been
recently used and these new methods are more reliable in soil microbial diversitystudies (Liu et al. 2006 ).

"constitutes metagenomics, transcriptomics, metaproteomics, and metabolomics.
Metagenomics techniques are based on the direct analysis of DNA extracted fromenvironmental samples and have circumvent the steps of isolation and culturing of
microbes. No single technique till date can measure the whole microbial diversity.
Biases are introduced at each treatment step as all of these techniques presentadvantages as well as drawbacks. Advanced screening approaches involvingfunction-driven and sequence-dependent metagenomics will provide deeper insightsof soil metagenome that will aid in sustaining crop management and soil fertility.

Bene ﬁcial Effects of Nitrogen-Fixing
Bacteria for Agriculture of the Future

Nitin Kumar
Abstract Nitrogen is one of the essential macronutrients (among N, P, and K) for
plant growth, and constitutes one of the most abundant elements in surface/crust and
earth ’s atmosphere, but still this nitrogen is not available for immediate uptake by
plants and crops are always facing nitrogen de ﬁciency as a crop nutrient in all part of
the globe. Nitrogen ﬁxation is necessary for life sustenance .In soil microbes that
carry nitrogen ﬁxation are termed as diazotrophs. Nitrogen- ﬁxing bacteria forms
symbiotic association with plants and fungi. In some plants there is formation of
nodules (in legume and actinorhizal, which ﬁx most of the nitrogen) and in some
nonnodulated (endosymbiont with cyanobacteria). In this chapter we have focused
upon the bene ﬁcial effects of nitrogen- ﬁxing bacteria for agriculture.",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,302

15.1 Introduction
Biological nitrogen ﬁxation is one of the vital processes for agricultural productivity
in most of the cropping systems as its inputs are the direct source for atmospheric
nitrogen and its rotational effects like disease and pest control (Vitousek et al. 2002 ,
Vats et al. 2019 ). Other recent advances in molecular biology techniques may issue
further new opportunities regarding the study of ecology of the root nodule bacteria.

"It may also help in the improvement of the selection of elite strains for inoculation
process. A basic understanding of the genetic basis of nodulation in pasture legumesincluding grains helps in the improvement of inoculation technologies (Kumar et al.
2020a ; Kumar et al. 2020b , Bhargava et al. 2020 ; Bhargava et al. 2019a ; Bhargava
et al. 2019b ).
Tropical and temperate pastures can also be improved with the use of other
effective measurements such as removal of nutritional constraints, inoculations,and by using some alternative legume species. When nitrogen ﬁxation in any crop
increases it may result into locating dif ﬁculties in the legumes host, the
microsymbiont, and the environment. The plant growth promoting bacteria is usedto improve the productivity of one of the most important cereals crops like maize and

"wheat (Ijaz et al. 2019 ). Many other researches in this ﬁeld have also enhanced the
understanding on the physiology of bacteria as well as the mechanism of bacteria –
plant interaction. Among all other bacteria, Azospirillum brasilense is one of the
most promising and important one. Other ﬁeld experiments have also shown
increase in productivity consistently. Moreover, Azospirillum is vital to genetic
studies and its importance in nitrogen metabolism is also known with its regulationof nitrogen ﬁxation (Coniglio et al. 2019 ). The knowledge accumulated leads to its
future genetic manipulation which leads in the maximization of the pros of plant
growth promoting bacteria. Environmental issues arising from the manufacturing
units of chemial fertilizers and their indiscriminate use has led to an increase in thereactive nitrogen in the atmosphere, hence there is an urgent need to focus uponbiological nitrogen ﬁxation (Torabian et al. 2019 ). Bacterial nitrogen ﬁxation (BNF)",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,303

nitrogen via the nitrogenase enzyme is catalyzed. Advances include discoveringalternate nitrogenases, clarifying information on mechanism of action, ﬁnding new
nitrogenases, presence of nitrogenase partners in eukaryotes, etc. New attempts are
being made to develop cereal plants to nodulate and ﬁx nitrogen (Bennett et al. 2020 ;
Gupta et al. 2018 ; Goel et al. 2017 ). The discovery by mycorrhization and nodula-
tion of speci ﬁc signaling mechanisms, cereal endophytes discovery, and advance-

The input of organic products and biological nitrogen ﬁxation in Indian agricul-
ture must be improved urgently. The production of competitive rhizobium strains,which are resistant to high temperature, drought, nitrate, acidity and other abioticstresses is very important (Bhattacharjee et al. 2008 ). The most rapids in Indian
agriculture are the methods of management of soil, including soil recuperation,nutrient de ﬁciency correction, organic application, and screening of segregation
materials in legumes in low-N soils, where the collection/breeding of high-
nodulation cultivars is not feasible. Inoculation may be a choice. The production
of transgenic inoculants, nitrogen-independent cereals, and entophytic N ﬁxation

15.2 Why Nitrogen Fixation is Important to Agriculture?
Nitrogen is found in abundance in the atmosphere and it is one of the most abundant
elements on earth (Kumar et al. 2020a ,2020b ; Saxena et al. 2019 ). 78% of the
earth ’s atmosphere is in the form of N 2.N2is the most important nutrient required for
plant growth as well as for their metabolic processes. The atmospheric nitrogen is
converted into usable form of nitrogen compound by nitrogen ﬁxation. There are
three ways through which atmospheric nitrogen can be converted into nitrate/ammonium which is found in the soil (Saxena et al. 2019 ; Anastasopoulou et al.
2016 ). The ﬁrst one is through atmospheric ﬁxation events like lightning strikes,
rain, snow which depends upon climatic changes. Another way is through man-madefertilizer which utilizes the Haber process which helps in the production of ammo-nium. Finally, there are some plants that had a symbiotic relationship with",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,304
"diazotrophic bacteria that ﬁx atmospheric nitrogen into ammonium (Oses et al.
2018 ). Diazotrophs are those bacteria which contains enzymes, i.e. nitrogenase
which is responsible for the process of biological nitrogen ﬁxation (BNF).
Diazotrophs include azotobacteraceae, cyanobacteria, frankia, green sulfur bacteria,and rhizobia. The wide range of plants which have symbiotic relationship withdiazotrophs comes from the legume family, i.e. known as Fabaceae (Feng et al.15 Bene ﬁcial Effects of Nitrogen-Fixing Bacteria for Agriculture of the Future 307",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,304
"2018 ). This family includes plants like alfalfa, clovers, lupines, peanuts, soybeans,
and rooibos. Legumes have certain root nodules that harbor the diazotrophs, providethem with the certain anaerobic conditions necessary to ﬁx nitrogen. After the plant
death the nitrogen which is ﬁxed is released and acts as a natural fertilizer for the soil
and it also helps in providing usable nitrogen to other non-legumes plants (Martin2017 ; Painuly et al. 2019 ; Vats and Kumar 2015 ).
The use of Haber process in the agriculture is mainly for the production of
fertilizers that is chemically ef ﬁcient which requires boiling, cooling and sustain to
very high pressure throughout the entire process (Pfromm, 2017 ). However, this also
requires the use of fossil fuels which results into the high costs to farmers. Around2% of the total world ’s energy goes into the production of fertilizers alone. By far,

promising biotechnological resource in the short term for increasing productivity inagriculture (Rosenblueth et al. 2018 ). For the plant growth and development,

promotion of plant growth depends on the ef ﬁcient interaction of plant and bacterial

to control the NifA role at two levels: the gene transcription and the proteinproduction of nifA, while oxygen and/or ﬁxed nitrogen regulation occurs at both
levels (Li et al. 2019 ). The ﬁrst isolation and the characterization of a mutant nifA

ADP dinitrogenase reductase (NifH) ribosylation in response to rising concentra-
tions of ammonium or energy loss. Such mechanism is considered as nitrogenase
turn-off and catalyzed by the dinitrogenase reductase ADP —ribosyltransferase
(DraT) (Souza et al. 2014 ). When an additional ammonium is supplied or energy
levels restored, the ADP-ribose group is separated from NifH by the dinitrogenasereductase.15 Bene ﬁcial Effects of Nitrogen-Fixing Bacteria for Agriculture of the Future 309",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,306

(DraG) can be triggered by the removal of ADP-ribose group and which further playan important role in activation of nitrogenase. The two enzymes are regulated in
reaction to the stimulus contrast: DraG is active and DraT is inactive in the nitrogen
ﬁxation setting, while ammonium addition leads to DraT activation and DraG
inactivation. A concept has been developed for DraT and DraG ammonium man-agement activities in A. brasilense (Souza et al. 2014 ). The PII proteins GlnB and
GlnZ are uridylylated and soluble in cytosol under nitrogen ﬁxation conditions.
DraG is active and DraT is inactive under this situation, so NifH does not alter orfunction. With the rise in ammonium levels, the uridlyly-removing enzyme GlnDdeuridylizes the PII proteins. Deuridylylated GlnB stimulates the DraT transmission

"In 1995 the Haber –Bosch cycle, approximately 100 Tg N per year of Ammonia,
of which about 86 percent was used to make fertilizers, ﬁxed approximately three
times as much N as Ammonia induced by cultivating BNF. With the establishment
of more plants, the industrial ﬁxation of nitrogen rises each year and by 2006 it
reached 121 Tg with the worldwide manufacture of 105 Tg of nitrogen fertilizer.While the conclusions are drawn that concerning the depletion of soil and its organicnitrogen content by synthetic nitrogen fertilizers, there can be no disagreement withthat a transition to agricultural diversi ﬁcation may be needed and applicable solution.
It can be achieved through legume-based crop rotations, which provide a valuablemeans of reducing the intensity of ammonia fertilization with the estimated ﬁxed N

legume area and 68% of world growth. The soybean was measured at 16.4 Tg N peryear, representing 77% of the N of the vegetables. Annual N2 ﬁxation production
was measured at 12 –25 Tg (pastures, legumes), 5 Tg (rice), 0.5 Tg (sugar canes),
<4 Tg (non-leguminous cropland), and <14 Tg (extensive savannas), totaling
50–70 Tg N ﬁxed in farming systems biologically. The average BNF values in

"BNF), cultivated in Indian farming, are 3.68 Tg per year.
15.10.1 Nitrogenase Biotechnology
The biological ﬁxation of nitrogen is an anaerobe cycle catalyzed by the nitrogenase
enzyme and involves machinery that assimilates reduction, ATP, and ammonia.Throughout the past century, and in particular over the last two decades in genetics
and biochemistry, tremendous progress was made in almost all aspects of biological
nitrogen attachment. Nitrogenase is encrypted by a variety of operons, includingregulatory genes such as nif LA, structural genes such as nif HDK and additionalgenes. The Klebsiella pneumonia was the E. BNF coli and the regulation, synthesis,and assembly of nitrogenase have been well studied. The whole K pneumonia nifcluster contains 20 genes in a 24 kb base pair DNA region (Burns and Hardy 2012 ).

It is long known that certain endophytic bacteria, which ﬁx nitrogen, are nodule-
independent associated with cereal crops. In order to pursue this strategy, new cerealendophytes that ﬁx nitrogen at high levels would also need screening. These
endophytes may be used in improved microbial inoculants, once they are identi ﬁed
and cultivated (Beatty and Good 2011 ).316 S. Vats et al.",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,313
"15.10.3 Advances in Non-Legume BNF
In strictly terms of science and BNF calculation methods, we need to study the work
of the past and make signi ﬁcant brain storms in the future. This applies particularly
to research on the contribution of associative symbiotic and endophytes. Three well-known species are Azotobacter, Azospirillum, and Gluconacetobacter in combina-tion with non-legume BNF.
Originally, they were all thought to encourage plant growth by ﬁxing nitrogen but
later it was realized that bacteria, including producing indole acetic acid and other
mechanisms could have growth-stimulating effects (Iannetta et al. 2016 ).
15.10.4 Heterotrophic N Fixation

possibility to repair non-symbiotic or associative or endophytic nitrogen in anagronomically relevant way (~20 kg N ha
/C01). The ﬁnal test of N2-mounted contri-
bution is the calculation of N2-mounted net inputs in long-term experiments ( >
10 years); the complexity of control and calculation is well-known for all pro-cedures. The inputs from N2- ﬁxation with cyanobacteria were due to positive N
balancing over long periods in the U.K region. Treatment-dependent sources of N
have confounded ﬁndings in controlled experiments (Perakis et al. 2017 ; Herridge
et al. 2008 ).

15.10.5 Endophytic N Fixation
Cereal rhizosphere, such as rice, is especially abundant in Azospirillum and Pseu-
domonas species, and in Enterobacteriaceae members. In addition, various membersof the genera Alcaligenes, Azotobacter, Burkholderia, Clostridium, Flavobacterium,
andXanthobacter have also been isolated with regard to endophytic diazotrophs
from paddy ﬁeld soils or wetland rice. Rice inoculation of Serratia marcescens
resulted in large numbers of this bacterium in intercellular spaces, senescent corticalroot cells, aerenchyma, and xylem vessels, but they are not identi ﬁed in intact host
cells. While endophytes are considered to play an important part for BNF in some
grasses in current thought, rice is only a relatively small sub-population of asigniﬁcantly greater rhizosphere diazotrophic population and therefore may have a
minor effect (Chalk and Craswell 2018 ). Studies have shown that, for a comparison,",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,314

function of N 2-ﬁxing endophytes, although many studies demonstrate their existence
within grasses and cereals, because the C distribution of roots, rhizosphere, and
endophytic bacteria is not fully understood. To properly evaluate the potential of
N2-ﬁxation in these plants, a detailed and comprehensive quantitative understanding
of both the grass C and N resources, their correspondence rhizosphere and endo-phytic bacteria is required (Moyes et al. 2016 ).
15.11 Advances in Legume BNF
The amount of nitrogen used in the world grain and oil saw production was
estimated at 20 percent for legumes. This is able to correct about 80% of its own
N requirements and also contribute to the yield of subsequent crops (Rubiales et al.2018 ). Nevertheless, only under certain circumstances can all these possible advan-",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,315

tages be utilized. The fact that the legume is included in the production method doesnot guarantee high BNF. Two approaches can be taken to exploit BNF: ﬁrst,
enhanced crop management, land management, and water management to achieveoptimum productivity of BNF and, second, inoculating rhizobium or selecting hostgenotypes in order to ensure a greater percentage of the nitrogen ﬁxation in the

"programmer (Rao 2014 ). Among these, the ﬁrst technique has been well established
and still plays the appropriate position for almost 50 years. In host plant selection,the second method is more recent. The discovery of new species has also resulted ina major revision of the rhizoidal taxonomy. There are some interesting disputesabout indigenous against exotic rhizobia strains, but most of them seem to beresolved, as most of the inoculants come out of indigenous adapted rhizobia. Thediversity, phylogeny, and rhizobial biogeography are of great concern today(Rubiales et al. 2018 ; Junior et al. 2020 ; Meena et al. 2018 ).
15.12 Climate Change and BNF

adverse humidity and temperature conditions (Lett and Michelsen 2014 ). This will
be an important aspect of the coping strategies for predicted warmer and drier futureclimate scenarios. Symbiotic N2 ﬁxing plants seem to have greater growth reactivity
than those of other functional groups. The capacity of N2 plants to respond to high
CO
2under soil conditions N enhances their competitiveness with non- ﬁxing plants
(Kantar et al. 2010 ). A review of 165 studies analyzing weed responses and
rangelands to global change shows that legume rates increase in grass-legumeswards by about 10% and atmospheric CO
2rates double. In the absence of environ-
mental restrictions including nutrient de ﬁciency, low temperature, or drought, higher318 S. Vats et al.",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,315
"atmospheric CO 2can overall stimulate the growth and N2 ﬁxation of most symbiotic
N2ﬁxation plants. And increased CO 2, which will rise with predicted changes in
precipitation intensity and frequency expected to follow the rise in CO 2, will provide
some defense against drought due to the decrease in N2.It greatly limits the charac-
terization of atmospheric environments under which N2 ﬁxation at high carbon
levels can or cannot be induced. Feedback on the N2 ﬁxation and photosynthesis
was not quanti ﬁed by the nutrient limiting results (Thomas et al. 2006 ; Vats et al.
2014 ; Vats et al. 2017 ; Vats et al. 2011 ).
15.12.1 Temperature Stress
N2ﬁxing plants and their related N2 strains —bacterial ﬁxation has remarkable
resistance to cold and warm temperature conditions. The major causes of nodulation

"failures are high temperature and humidity de ﬁcit; the upper limits of rhizobium
growth were 32-47/C14C; the upper limits of tropical legumes were lower with N2
attachment at 27 –40/C14C.Temperature can also change the result of competition
among strains. Several experiments have explored the relationship between highCO
2and low N 2-ﬁxing temperatures and this usually supports the idea that high CO 2
effects are stronger at high temperatures (Zahran 1999 ; Kajic et al. 2016 ; Gao et al.

which survive and adapt to these adverse environmental conditions may triggereffective inoculants strains for crops that are grown under drought pressure. Tem-perature and drying stress were less tolerant than ﬁeld isolates to commercial strains.
Desiccation decreases the activity of water and enhances the capacity of some
microorganisms to remain drying due to osmotic or salt stresses, and some have
argued that desiccated microorganisms are required for use as dry seed inoculations.The capacity of microorganisms, including rhizobia, to survive drying depends ontheir ability to cope with diverse stresses, including solvents and extremes intemperature (Zahran 1999 ; Arora et al. 2017 ).

limited conditions depends on the degree of temperature tolerance between the15 Bene ﬁcial Effects of Nitrogen-Fixing Bacteria for Agriculture of the Future 319",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,316

tropical areas with a matrix water capacity of /C00.5 to/C01.5 m Pa.

Soil P is likely to greatly reduce symbiotic plants ’responses to carbon dioxide
enrichment and experimental evidence indicates the need for suf ﬁcient soil P for
elevated CO 2to have a positive impact on the symbiosis of N 2. Soya plants fertilized
adequately with P were receptive to higher CO 2masses of nodule, unique activity of
nodules, and total plant N, but this was removed in soil P de ﬁciency. Fixing soil

15.12.4 Salinity Stress
Soil salinity problems will increase in the future water-limited environment. In
addition, the agriculture must progressively rely on recycled waters due to thedemand for limited quantities of water in response to industry and infrastructure
needs. Legumes are more prone to salinity and alkalinity than cereals in general.

"15.13 Conclusion
This review concludes that for a sustainable agrosystem, the use of nitrogen ﬁxing
bacteria can enhance the agricultural productivity. The interaction of plant based onits genotype and bacteria based on its species has signi ﬁcant role in ef ﬁciency of
nitrogen ﬁxation. The production level in maize, rice, and wheat has been increased
by the use of plant growth promoting bacteria. Both free living and symbioticbacteria have their role to play. Nitrogen ﬁxation by bacteria offers a sustainable
approach and an alternative strategy to chemical based nitrogen ﬁxation/supplemen-
tation. The need of the hour is use of biotechnological tool to make bacteria based
nitrogen ﬁxation more productive and competitive to chemical based nitrogen
supply.

Abstract The concept of functional diversity assists in comprehension of natural
intricacy during the widespread cooperation that microorganisms depict with other
populations and ecological systems as how they communicate. Principally, micro-
organisms consist of several traits that describe their function inside ecological
systems. Plant root associated bacteria that inhabit the plant root as ectophytes or
endophytes and be capable of precisely boosting plant development through
enhanced nourishment, production of plant hormones, mitigation of deleterious
effect of different plant associated pathogens, and ﬁghting for colonization sites on
plants are referred as plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR). Therefore, the

"plants are referred as plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR). Therefore, the
application of speci ﬁc nitrogen- ﬁxing plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria in the
form of microbial inoculants (single or mixed) can minimize the addiction of
chemically synthesized fertilizers without compromising the crop yield. Despite
their potential to enhance crop productivity and improved crop protection,
nitrogen- ﬁxing PGPR still have to cover a long distance to compete as effective
bioinoculants. Therefore, there is urgent need to learn the functional diversity of
nitrogen- ﬁxing PGPR for sustainable crop production. Keeping in view the author

"16.1 Introduction
One of the key tests of the twenty- ﬁrst century is to provide and produce suf ﬁcient
quantity of food for the rising population. The United Nations Population Fund(UNFPA) projected that the global community will swell to 11.2 billion by 2100(Alexandratos and Bruinsma 2012 ; Rana et al. 2020 ). The developed countries
maintained their high agricultural productivity through high yielding varietieswhich are directly dependent on the application of chemical fertilizers, agrochemi-cals, and several other synthetic chemicals. Whereas, inside growing nations, foresthas been swung into agricultural soil, creating danger of extinction to world biolog-
ical diversity (Angus and Hirsch 2013 ). Similarly, India ’s population is projected to
increase to 1.45 billion by 2028 ( https://www.unfpa.org ›data ›transparency-

works as an important component, however most of the pro ﬁt crops are not capable
of absorbing dinitrogen (Nitrogen) from the atmosphere (Fox et al. 2016 ). Since
decades, high amount of chemically synthesized nitrogen manure have been appliedto enhance crop yield in order to satisfy the hunger of growing earth population. Onthe other hand, merely 30 –50% of the used synthetic manure is taken up by the crop
plants, and at the same time remaining half amount is disappeared into the atmo-
sphere through the process of volatilization (ammonia-NH
3) and leaching (Anderson
et al. 2018 ). Injudicious application of synthetic manure severely impacts the soil

Nitrogen- ﬁxing plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria consist together of symbi-

Among these, microbes that are able to formroot nodules in contact with leguminous plants and convert atmospheric nitrogen(N) into working shape of nitrogen are usually referred as rhizobia (a universal wordemployed to designate every rhizobial genera jointly) (Lindstrom and Martinez-

Beijerinck ( 1888 ). Frank ( 1889 ) renamed this bacterium as Rhizobium

attractive plant growth-promoting characters alone from their regular nitrogen ﬁxa-
tion capability (Ghosh et al. 2015 ). When used appropriately, they continue to apply
different positive developments on several key crop plants (García-Fraile et al.2012 ). Unreasonably, nitrogen- ﬁxing PGPR are capable of enhancing the develop-

16.2 Biological Nitrogen Fixation (BNF)
The process of nitrogen ﬁxation is a vibrant and requires huge amount of power
(Rosenblueth et al. 2018 ). The track for the biological devaluation of inert nitrogen
into the reactive complex ammonia (NH 3) under micro-aerobic situations is as

Among legumes and rhizobia, Gram-negative alphaproteobacteria are one of the common bacterial species that connect (endosymbi-otic relations) with legumes of the Fabaceae (Papilionaceae) family (Schultze andKondorosi 1998 ; Desbrosses and Stougaard 2011 ).

also similar to the amount of synthetic nitrogen based fertilizers employed intraditional agriculture practices (McNeill and Fillery 2008 ; Unkovich et al. 2010 ).
In addition, rhizosphere discharge by legumes is an extra signi ﬁcant resource of
accessible nitrogen along with new vital plant nutriment (Khan et al. 2002 ). Some of
the legumes frequently used by humans as food are dry bean, chickpea ( Cicer

Nitrogen ﬁxation through the process of symbiotic relationship by soybean roots
with Rhizobia plays a vital role in the development and maturation of plants
(Fig. 16.1). The rise in the capacity of nitrogen ﬁxation is related to the enhanced
yield. Fodder legumes are routinely cultivated under wide range of climatic condi-tions and these crops possess the capability to provide increased crop yield together

recognition as a friendly fodder crop in grasslands (Adhikari and Missaoui 2017 ).

interpretation from the di-nitrogenase reductase encrypted gene ( nifH) phylogenet-
ically analogous to the indicated Bradyrhizobium spp. and Azorhizobium sp. was
plentifully reported within the nitrogen- ﬁxing sugarcane, sweet potato stems, and
storage tubers. Setaria viridis , with Setaria italica (foxtail millet), is able to capture a
considerable portion of ﬁxed nitrogen through cooperations in the company of
Azospirillum brasilense (Pankievicz et al. 2015 ; Mahmud et al. 2020 ). Additional
potential relations comprise Azoarcus sp. strain BH72, Kallar grass, Klebsiella
pneumoniae , and wheat (Iniguez et al. 2004 ). A rhizosphere-connected nitrogen
ﬁxation takes place in three methods. Initially, rhizobia utilize “crack entry ”(a lack332 M. M. Altaf",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,328

march into xylem parenchyma tissues by means of cortical cells in incise sugarcanestems and sweet potato tuber. Subsequently, within inadequate oxygen concentra-
tion or micro-aerobic situations, rhizobia might demonstrate free-living nitrogen
ﬁxation; such as Bradyrhizobium spp., nodulates Aeschynomene andParasponia ,
Azorhizobium caulinodans , nodulates Sesbania rostrata , and Burkholderia ,
nodulates Mimosa , and all these rhizobia are competent enough to ﬁx nitrogen

to establish vague cooperation with root system of other plants with no noduleformation (Reyes and Schimidt 1979 ). Asymbiotic relationship attributes to a
broad diversity of nitrogen- ﬁxing species that inhabit the roots of nonleguminous

within nonlegume plant tissues primarily via fractures within epidermal cells of theroot structure and in crevices wherever lateral root system has come out (Dazzo and
Yanni 2006 ). Instantly, the rhizobial endophytic organization starts through root
migration that is pursued through fracture access into the root core via alienatedepidermal cells (Sprent and Faria 1988 ). Subsequently, endophytes constantly move
to the stem base, leaf cover, and leaves where they develop quickly to elevatedinhabitant ’s thickness (Chi et al. 2005 ). After that they might affect plant develop-

Nitrogen-Fixing Rhizobacteria just like other traditional asymbiotic PGPR might
inﬂuence the crop plant growth and development through direct and indirect
methods (Fig. 16.2). The explicit methods through which nitrogen ﬁxers prop up
the development of nonlegumes comprise the solubilization of insoluble phosphatethrough rhizobia, Azospirillum andBurkholderia that change insoluble phosphorous
into soluble structure by the process of acidi ﬁcation, discharge of organic acids or
protons and chelation, thus serving to develop phosphate nourishment in theconnected plant species (Abd-Alla 1994 ; Richardson et al. 2009 ). Symbiotic

aspect, given that it is connected through inhibition of plant disease causing bacteriathrough prevention of iron absorption. Furthermore, siderophore generating capa-bility facilitates in the survival of rhizobia within iron insuf ﬁcient soils (Lesueur

capability in increasing the crop productivity together with maintaining soil featureand fecundity, use of such bio ﬁlm based bioinoculants stays behind globally because
of its inception problems within the rhizosphere. The bio ﬁlm based bioinoculants
will thrive better in the rhizosphere as useful invention if it consists of nativemicroorganisms because they will sustain site speci ﬁc characters ef ﬁciently (Altaf

16.11 Nitrogen-Fixing Rhizobacteria and Nanoparticles
Nanotechnology unlocks a broad horizon of new task related to the area of farming
in order to accomplish the food requirements of ever increasing inhabitants of theworld. Nanoparticles (NPs) possess distinguishing physico-chemical characters, i.e.,good surface region, tunable pore size, high reactivity along with particle morphol-ogy. Administration of highly appropriate source of nourishment for feasible cropproduction is a leading topic of research in farming. The use of nanotechnology hasbeen extensively exploited in different farming area and abundant information ispresented on the relevance of nanomaterials (NMs) in the area of plant protection
(Servin et al. 2015 ; Vishwakarma et al. 2018 ). The nanomaterials are favored above",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,338
"(Servin et al. 2015 ; Vishwakarma et al. 2018 ). The nanomaterials are favored above
traditional manures owing to improved source use effectiveness, least fertilizerutilization, gradual and continued discharge of nutrients, better plant developmentand productivity with nominal soil disturbance. In addition they also work asmagical dose for a well-organized discharge of dynamic compounds and genesintended for enhancement of crop well-being (Pérez-de-Luque and Rubiales2009 ). An illustration of this style of release method is accounted via Torney et al.
(2007 ) with the growth of mesoporous silica NPs that have been created with
chemical compounds and work as a gene transporter for the transmittance of genes
to tobacco and corn plants. The cell walls then take up the NPs and the marked genesare ef ﬁciently moved to the anchor plant in an environmental friendly method. NMs
not only work in the growth of new and ef ﬁcient biologically active products",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,338
"not only work in the growth of new and ef ﬁcient biologically active products
containing one or more bene ﬁcial microbial strains like insecticides or pesticides
to increase a viable crop health methods (Gajbhiye et al. 2009 ). The exploitation of
silica NPs has been found earlier for gene transport within bacterial cells and thissystem could be used for the growth of numerous new biological control means
(Torney 2009 ). In addition, the utilization of nanoemulsions was also demonstrated
for the growth of pesticides in opposition to plant disease causing microbes (Wanget al. 2007 ). NPs of zinc oxide, copper oxide, and cerium oxide have also been used
in sweet potato for their bioaccessibility (Brad ﬁeld et al. 2017 ). Conversely, there is
also information of harmful impact of nanoparticles on bacterial passageways. Like342 M. M. Altaf",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,338
"McGee ( 2020 ) accounted that silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) probably create consid-
erable danger for microbial nitrogen cycling species.
16.12 Conclusion
Nitrogen- ﬁxing rhizobacteria are acknowledged for their constructive impact devel-
oping from the synergetic and nonsymbiotic nitrogen ﬁxation process. Currently, the
information associated with complex environment of the plant root system, func-tional diversity within nitrogen- ﬁxing plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria ,mech-
anisms of their work, processes of biofertilizer improvement, along with theirdischarge system has enhanced considerably. In contrast, there are several problemsassociated with their large-scale utilization, such as their uncertainty under ﬁeld
conditions. This problem can be alleviated through the use of nitrogen- ﬁxing plant
growth-promoting rhizobacteria in bio ﬁlm mode. Nitrogen- ﬁxing rhizobacteria",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,339

Abstract Biological nitrogen ﬁxation (BNF) is a sustainable approach to reduce
negative effects of chemical N fertilizers on ecosystem. Therefore, BNF has gained
special attention in researchers for enhancing its effectiveness among different crop
plants. The genetic mutation approach in bacterial spp. towards ef ﬁcient symbiosis
and plant growth promotion is an attractive strategy nowadays. In addition, positive
mutants of plant growth promoting rhizobacterial (PGPR) strains could survive
under harsh conditions and promote plant growth also. The objectives of the present
chapter are to highlight the basic mechanisms of induced mutation in bacteria and
applied aspects of these mutated bacteria for improving nitrogen- ﬁxing abilities in
plants.

"17.1 Introduction
Rhizosphere encompasses the soil volume that is under the in ﬂuence of plant root.
As compared to bulk soil, rhizospheric soil is a hot spot of microbial diversity (morethan 10 to 100 times) due to the presence of variety of nutrients secreted by rootexudates (amino acids, sugars, enzymes, and organic acids) (Gray and Smith 2005 ).
The secreted compounds also act as chemo-attractant for a diverse range of plantbeneﬁcial microbes, thus involved in symbiotic plant –microbe interaction, growth
promotion, and disease suppression. The pattern of these compounds varies fromone plant species to other and their holobiont (Kang et al. 2010 ). Therefore,
rhizospheric region has been mostly focused in agricultural research for many
years. The rhizospheric engineering including microbial or metabolic changes forsustainable plant growth has gained attention recently.

17.2 Plant –Microbe Interactions in the Rhizosphere
The rhizospheric interaction between plant and microbes is essential for uptake of
water and nutrients (Ryan et al. 2009 ). The rhizospheric microbes are involved in
biogeochemical cycling of various essential nutrients and also helpful for soilremediation (Choudhary et al. 2015 ). These microbes depend on each other as
well as plant exudates for nutrient source. Hence, rhizosphere is a very dynamic
ecological unit of plant holobiont interaction. The bene ﬁcial effect of rhizospheric
microbes can vary upon their colonization with host plants. These microbes cancolonize in rhizospheric soil, root surface, and intracellular region of plants(McCully 2001 ). In addition, microbial colonization with host plants also depends",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,346
"on their genetic traits, root exudates, and abiotic and biotic factors (Benizri et al.2001 ). Most of the microbial cells ﬁrst colonized in the rhizospheric soil and then
some of the species attached on root surface and subsequently entered inside the root
cells (Compant et al. 2010 ). The colonization in root not occurs in a uniform manner,
different microbial populations are reported for diverse root zones. For instance, agram negative motile bacterium Kluyvera ascorbata is able to colonize at upper
surface of canola roots but not detected around the root tips (Vessey 2003 ).
In many rhizospheric relationships, the plant growth promoting rhizobacteria
(PGPR) are known to colonize the plant root and stimulate plant growth. PGPRcan exert their bene ﬁcial effects on plants by two ways, i.e. direct or indirect. In
direct mechanism, PGPR increase nutrient availability in soil through solubilizing
inorganic and organic complex compounds, nitrogen ﬁxation, and siderophore",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,346
"direct mechanism, PGPR increase nutrient availability in soil through solubilizing
inorganic and organic complex compounds, nitrogen ﬁxation, and siderophore

including Azospirillum ,Bacillus ,Pseudomonas, Arthrobacter, Rhizobium,
Burkholderia, Proteus, Enterobacter, Serratia, Xanthomonas , etc. genera350 A. Vaishnav et al.",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,346
"(Steenhoudt and Vanderleyden 2000 ; Trivedi et al. 2005 ). On the basis of interaction
with host plants, PGPR are divided into two groups: symbiotic bacteria (iPGPR) and
free-living rhizobacteria (ePGPR) (Gray and Smith 2005 ). The use of PGPR is
steadily increasing in agriculture practices as biofertilizers and biopesticides.
17.3 Biological Nitrogen Fixation
Nitrogen is an essential nutrient in plant development and productivity, accountsapprox. 2% of total dry weight that enters into food chain. The available sourcesof nitrogen for plants are ammonium and nitrates present in the soil. The limitation ofnitrogen sources and their requirement for plants has generated a large number ofchemical based N fertilizers (Westhoff 2009 ). About 60% of chemical N-fertilizers
are used for cereals cultivation, even 10% in rice growth. The irregular use ofchemical N fertilizer causes nitrate contamination in soil and ground water, leading",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,347
"are used for cereals cultivation, even 10% in rice growth. The irregular use ofchemical N fertilizer causes nitrate contamination in soil and ground water, leading
to negative impact on health and agricultural sustainability. Moreover, manufactur-
ing process for N fertilizer requires six times more energy than other fertilizers(Da Silva et al. 1978 ). Another process is biological N
2ﬁxation (BNF) by which
plant can uptake atmospheric N 2(approx. 2/3rd) with the help of symbiotic micro-
organisms. This process is economically and eco-friendly alternative of chemicalfertilizers. The symbiotic microorganisms are able to ﬁx nitrogen or ammonia in

"plants through nitrogenase enzyme complex. These microbes are generally distrib-
uted in nature and work at mild temperatures. Nitrogen- ﬁxing organisms are gener-
ally categorized in symbiotic and non-symbiotic organisms. Symbiotic organisms
make association with leguminous plants and non-leguminous tree, i.e. Rhizobium
andFrankia (Ahemad and Khan 2011 ). In non-symbiotic association, free-living
microbes and endophytes ﬁx nitrogen, i.e. Cyanobacteria ( Anabaena, Nostoc ),
Azospirillum, Azotobacter, Gluconoacetobacter diazotrophicus ,Azoarcus , etc.
(Antoun et al. 1978 ; Riggs et al. 2001 ). Non-symbiotic microbes ﬁx a less amount
of nitrogen as compared to symbiotic microorganism (Glick 1995 ). In addition, plant
growth promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) are also able to ﬁxN 2in non-leguminous
plants through a non-obligate interaction with the host plants (Glick et al. 1999 ).

17.4 Bacterial Strain Improvement
A growing demand of food for burgeoning population requires sustainable agricul-
ture practices (Tilman et al. 2011 ). Food security of such a huge population will
require increased agricultural production with increased productivities in the sameland area. Development of overproducing PGPR mutants or strain improvementcould be a more bene ﬁcial alternative to increase the productivity with the conven-
tional approaches. Mutation is an instant change in genes character that is differentfrom wild type. Mutations allowing new versions of DNA combinations can be
harmful, benign, or bene ﬁcial. If mutations are harmful, they tend to be self-
eliminating, unless they only show up after breeding age. Mutations which arebenign may not in ﬂuence the species. Mutations which are bene ﬁcial improve",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,348
"eliminating, unless they only show up after breeding age. Mutations which arebenign may not in ﬂuence the species. Mutations which are bene ﬁcial improve
varieties of the organisms resulting in greater diversity and therefore greater adapt-ability in the species. Only mutations which are bene ﬁcial are of great use in the
process of development of new organisms, individual, or variety, etc. Strainimprovement for PGP activity can be approached by two types, i.e. direct orcombinational. In direct approach, genetic sequence is known, while in combination
sequence is unknown and two approaches used together for screen out.
17.5 Mechanism of Mutation

also be induced arti ﬁcially with the help of some physical or chemical agents
(mutagens). Mutagenesis is described as a process to develop mutation in livingcells either through chemical or physical approach. The ﬁrst reported case of",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,348
"(mutagens). Mutagenesis is described as a process to develop mutation in livingcells either through chemical or physical approach. The ﬁrst reported case of
artiﬁcial induced mutations was back in 1920 with work on Drosophila , maize,
and barley. On the basis of mutagens the mutagenesis can be broadly classi ﬁed as:352 A. Vaishnav et al.",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,348
"17.6 Physical Mutagenesis
Physical mutagenesis is induced by physical mutagens including radiations (gamma
rays, X-rays, UV rays, and neutron particles). Such radiations fall in the wavelengthrange below 340 nm and photon energy above 1 electro-volt (eV). These radiationscan damage DNA by directly through ionization/excitation or indirectly throughreactive free radicals. Y-rays have a lower effectiveness for mutations, hence ahigher dose is required to obtain positive results (Van Harten 1998).
17.7 Chemical Mutagenesis
A variety of chemical mutagens induce mutations in living cell. The ﬁrst report of
mutagenic action of a chemical was in 1942 by Charlotte Auerbach, who showed
that nitrogen mustard could cause mutations in cells (Auerbach 1949 ). Most chem-
ical mutagens are alkylating agents, azides, and base analogs (Andrea and Afza2003 ). Both, in vitro and in vivo, methyl is most reactive with nucleic acids fallowed",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,349
"ical mutagens are alkylating agents, azides, and base analogs (Andrea and Afza2003 ). Both, in vitro and in vivo, methyl is most reactive with nucleic acids fallowed
by ethyl and higher homologues. Some of the most used alkalizing agents to inducemutation are N-methyl-N
0-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (NTG), dimethyl sulfate
(DMS), ethyl methane sulfonate (EMS), ethyl ethane sulfonate (EES). N-Methyl-N
0-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (NTG), one of the most potent chemical mutagen has
been widely used to induce mutations in bacteria for a long time (D Moore 1969 ).
NTG creates changes in nucleic acid sequences by mutations including substitutionof nucleotide base-pairs and insertions and deletions of one or more nucleotides inDNA sequences (Mishra and Goel 1999 ; Rasila et al. 2009; Harper and Lee 2012).",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,349
"Azides are another class of chemical mutagens which are frequently used in muta-genesis. Sodium azide (NAN3) is a well established chemical mutagen for basetransition mutation. An experiment conducted by Berger et al. (1953) revealed thatsodium azide increased the occurrence of mutants resistant to penicillin. Nilan et al.
(1973 ) found high reversion frequencies through sodium azide in Salmonella
typhimurium mutant TA1530 (Nilan et al. 1973 ). The azido derivatives of ethidium
bromide were found highly mutagenic for yeast and in Salmonella typhimurium
(Morita and Yielding 1977 ; Yielding et al. 1976 ). In an experiment, azide analogs of
proﬂavine and acri ﬂavine were found to produce mutation in excision-repair de ﬁ-
cient Salmonella strains (Owais et al. 1979 ). 5-Bromouracil (5-BU) and

through two mechanisms: directly, by mispairing with cytosine, and indirectly, bysaturation of mismatch repair in E. coli (Photini et al. 2004 ).17 Bacterial Mutants for Enhanced Nitrogen Fixation 353",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,349
"17.8 Site-Directed Mutagenesis
Site-directed mutagenesis (SDM), also known as directed mutagenesis, is method for
creating a speci ﬁc mutation in a known sequence. It is an in vitro technique where
mutations are generated by PCR using a pair of oligonucleotide primers designedwith mismatching nucleotides at the center of the primers (Oded et al. 2009 ). In this
approach, one part of targeted gene is ampli ﬁed by PCR primer and then the PCR
product is used as mega primer for amplifying whole gene. To screen out mutation, arestriction enzyme site is introduced into target gene during PCR process. Throughthis process, we can generate single and multiple mutations in a gene. In a study,R. meliloti genome was mutated with Escherichia coli transposon Tn 5for symbiotic
nitrogen ﬁxation gene through site-directed mutagenesis (Ausubel and Ruvkun
1981 ).

"17.9 Bacterial Mutation for Enhanced Nitrogen Fixation
The bacterial nitrogenase enzymes play important role in conversion of atmospheric
nitrogen into ammonia. It is expected that approx. 100 million metric tonnes of N 2
are converted by the nitrogenase activity per annum (Downie 2014 ). In this context,
biological nitrogen ﬁxation (BNF) process covers major (about 2/3) portion in ﬁxing
atmospheric nitrogen, while the rest part is performed by Haber –Bosch process.
BNF is ﬁrstly discovered in prokaryotes by Beijerinck in 1901 (Wagner 2012 ).
However, this process supplies only 20 –25% of total nitrogen requirements in
cereals like rice and maize (Montanez et al. 2012 ). Although an enormous progress
has been developed in nitrogen- ﬁxing symbiosis between rhizobia and legumes,
utilization of this knowledge to induce BNF in cereals is still less explored (Dixonand Arntzen 1997 ). In this context, genetic engineering techniques and mutagenesis",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,351

ingAzospirillum brasilense mutants enhanced the nitrogen supply in wheat plant.
The mutant strain possessed two to three times higher nitrogenase activity as
compared to the wild type. Furthermore, a point mutation in glutamine synthetaseenzyme in Azospirillum leads to higher ammonium ﬁxation for better plant growth in

Perspectives on Nitrogen-Fixing Bacillus
Species
Shekhar Jain, Ajit Varma, and Devendra Kumar Choudhary
Abstract Not all prokaryotes capable of biological nitrogen ﬁxation require nod-
ules to ﬁx nitrogen (N 2). A wide range of Bacillus genus members have been
reported for their N 2-ﬁxing ability, as they can ﬁx and provide N 2to a wide range
of host plants. Besides N 2ﬁxation, these bacteria possess several plant growth –
promoting abilities such as growth hormone production, phosphate solubilization,
and siderophore production for iron acquisition. They also have the capability to
protect plants against phytopathogens through production of cell wall –degrading
enzymes and antibiotic metabolites, and also through elicitation of plant defense
systems. This chapter reviews and discusses the role of Bacillus spp. in N 2ﬁxation
and perspectives on their agricultural development.

18.1 Introduction
Being a key component of nucleotides, proteins, and chlorophyll in plants, nitrogen
is the most important element for life. It is found in abundance in the atmosphere, of
which it constitutes about 78%, but it is actually inaccessible to plants because of its
diatomic form (N 2), due to the presence of a double band (Galloway et al. 2003 ). The
inert nature of nitrogen forces farmers to use chemical N 2fertilizers to maintain
optimum yields, but there are several drawbacks that necessitate implementation of
alternative strategies to retain N 2in soil in order to maintain plant growth. Besides
being expensive, N 2fertilizers contribute signi ﬁcantly to greenhouse gas emissions

"(Wang et al. 2007 ). Additionally, because of denitri ﬁcation, volatilization, and
leaching, soil becomes very vulnerable to loss of nitrogen, which is very reactiveand mobile. Furthermore, its leached reactive form can cause several environmental
problems and negative effects on human health (Williamson 2011 ; Robertson and
Vitousek 2009 ). In view of the adverse effects on the ecosystem, along with the
steadily increasing cost of N
2fertilizer, cultivators have adapted crop rotation
policies. Crop rotation bene ﬁts the agricultural system and adds ﬁxed N 2into soil
through the process of biological N 2ﬁxation (Eskin et al. 2014 ; Peoples et al. 1995 ).
Some prokaryotes have the capability to ﬁxN 2by reducing dinitrogen to ammonia in
a process known as biological N 2ﬁxation (BNF). Symbiosis between leguminous
plants and Rhizobium is the best example of N 2ﬁxation, but not all plants have
achieved symbiosis with an N 2-ﬁxing prokaryote (Vessey et al. 2005 ). Nodule",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,356

18.2 Role of Bacillus Species in Nitrogen Fixation
Bacillus , an endospore-forming genus, is a systematically diverse taxon, which
includes aerobic and rod-shaped bacteria (Claus and Berkeley 1986 ).Bacillus spp.

"resistant endospores, production of a multilayered cell wall structure, and secretion
of peptide signaling molecules, peptide antibiotics, and extracellular enzymes.Along with these traits, they have noteworthy variations in other important charac-teristics such as utilization of nutrients, ability to move, and physiochemical growthoptima. Because of quantitative and qualitative variations in these characteristics,these bacteria show diversity and inhabit various niches in agroecosystems(Choudhary and Johri 2009 ; Gardener 2004 ). The potential to ﬁxN
2is broadly
dispersed among phylogenetically different bacteria. Conventionally, N 2ﬁxation is
catalyzed by an enzyme complex known as nitrogenase. There are two main
components of the nitrogenase enzyme complex: the iron (Fe) protein, which isencoded by the nifH gene, and the molybdenum iron (MoFe) protein, which is
encoded by nifDK genes. The sequence of the nifH gene is evolutionarily conserved

"encoded by nifDK genes. The sequence of the nifH gene is evolutionarily conserved

2ﬁxation. Primers designed on the basis of the nifH gene
sequence are used extensively to detect the genetic potential of bacteria to ﬁxN 2in
any ecological state (Auman et al. 2001 ; Rosch et al. 2002 ; Mehta et al. 2003 ).
Although very little research has been done regarding the role of Bacillus spp. in
N2ﬁxation, several researchers have isolated N 2-ﬁxing isolates from different
sources and checked them molecularly for N 2-ﬁxing ability. In earlier studies,
Paenibacillus azoto ﬁxans,P. macerans , and P. polymyxa were found to be N 2ﬁxers
on the basis of their nitrogenase activity (Witz et al. 1967 ; Seldin et al. 1984 ).
Additionally, other Paenibacillus spp.—namely, P. odorifer , P. graminis,
P. peoriae , and P. brasilensis —were described as N 2ﬁxers in various research
studies (Elo et al. 2001 ; Berge et al. 2002 ; Von der Weid et al. 2002 ). Besides360 S. Jain et al.",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,356
"Paenibacillus spp., Xie et al. ( 1998 ) reported that many Bacillus members —namely,
B. megaterium, B. cereus, B. pumilus, B. circulans ,B. licheniformis , B. subtilis,
B. brevis, and B.ﬁrmus—were N 2-ﬁxing bacteria on the basis of their nitrogenase
activity. However, it was only detection of the nifH gene that identi ﬁed in
P. azoto ﬁxans,P. macerans ,P. polymyxa ,P. graminis , and P. odorifer as nitrogen
ﬁxers (Achouak et al. 1999 ; Berge et al. 2002 ). Ding et al. ( 2005 ) conﬁrmed the N 2
ﬁxation potential of B. maris ﬂaviand P. massiliensis by using degenerate primers for

sp. SJ-5 by growing it on Jensen ’s medium, which is devoid of N 2, and further
conﬁrmed it by ampli ﬁcation of the ferredoxin –nitrite reductase gene. Jiang et al.

"18.2.1 Nitrogen Metabolism in Bacillus Species
Prior to the development of arti ﬁcial methods for N 2ﬁxation to obtain fertilizers,
roughly all N 2present in living organisms was converted into ammonia by microbial
reduction. Biological reduction of N 2is a process of utmost signi ﬁcance and
certainly has been vital for sustaining life on the earth (Ruiz-Herrera et al. 2015 ).
Whereas enteric bacteria have a two-component Ntr regulatory system, rapidly
metabolizable N 2sources regulate N 2metabolism genes in B. subtilis. In Bacillus
spp., depending on nutrient availability, three regulatory proteins —namely, CodY,
GlnR, and TnrA —independently control expression of gene products involved in N 2
metabolism. Under different nutritional conditions, each of these systems gets
activated. CodY is suppressed in cells growing quickly with amino acids, GlnR is18 Perspectives on Nitrogen-Fixing Bacillus Species 361",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,357

MerR family of DNA-binding regulatory proteins, bind to similar DNA sequences(glnRA ; dicistronic operons) under different nutritional conditions. The B. subtilis
glnRA operon contains genes encoding glutamine synthetase and the negative
regulatory protein GlnR. N
2-depriving conditions activate TnrA protein, while
GlnR-dependent repression occurs in cells growing with surplus N 2(Wray et al.
1998 ). In the case of excess N 2, GlnR not only represses the glnRA promoter but also",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,358
"GlnR-dependent repression occurs in cells growing with surplus N 2(Wray et al.

represses expression of the tnrA andureABC P3 promoters (Wray et al. 1997 ; Fisher
1999 ). Therefore, GlnR and TnrA cross-regulate each other ’s expression, along with
regulating their own synthesis (Fig. 18.1).
The nitrogen signals regulating the activity of GlnR and TnrA have not been
identi ﬁed, and it is still not clear whether both of these respond to different signals or
the same signals. However, it has been reported that glutamine synthetase is requiredfor transduction of the signal for nitrogen availability to both proteins (Atkinson andFisher 1991 ; Nakano et al. 1998 ; Ferson et al. 1996 ). Studies have suggested that
regulated expression by both of these proteins permits cells to adapt to growth during

18.3 Applications of Nitrogen-Fixing Bacillus Species
Although N 2ﬁxation itself is very important for survival of plants and growth
promotion, several members of the Bacillus genus perform different plant growth –
promoting and plant –protecting activities, which can be exploited for sustainable
agricultural development. Enhancements in plant health and yield are mediated by
three different ecological mechanisms: (1) antagonism of pests and pathogens,
(2) promotion of host nutrition and growth, and (3) elicitation of plant host defensesystems.

"18.4 Bacillus Species as Plant Growth Promoters
Plant growth –promoting bacteria (PGPBs) play a major role in sustainable agricul-
ture. Bacillus spp. have been reported to be potent plant growth promoters and may
promote plant health by in ﬂuencing the plant host or mutualistic symbionts. Various
isolates of B. amyloliquefaciens, B. cereus, B. sphaericus , B. subtilis, B. mycoides ,
and B. pumilus have been reported to induce the host ’s resistance pathways in a local
or systemic manner. Different hormones produced by B. subtilis (e.g., auxins,gibberellins, and cytokinins, which are involved in plant cell enlargement, division,and enlargement of symbiotic and nonsymbiotic roots) may affect growth of hostplants (Priest 1993 ). The root is the main part of a plant; it is responsible for nutrient
acquisition from soil and forms a solid base from which to grow shoots. Several
Paenibacillu s and Bacillus spp. have been reported to enhance root growth and",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,359

2016 ; Porcel et al. 2014 ). Levels of ethylene, the only gaseous hormone responsible
for plant growth inhibition, increase in plants in stress conditions. Some Bacillus
spp. reduce ethylene levels by degrading 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate(ACC), the immediate precursor of ethylene, into 2-oxobutanoate and ammoniathrough production of ACC deaminase enzyme, thereby directly increasing plant

Bacterial polysaccharides can bind soil particles to form microaggregates andmacroaggregates. Plants treated with exopolysaccharide (EPS)-producing bacteriadisplay increased resistance to water stress due to improved soil structure. Jain et al.(2016 ) reported the EPS-producing activity of Bacillus sp. SJ-5. EPS can also bind to
cations, including Na
+, thus making it unavailable to plants under saline conditions.18 Perspectives on Nitrogen-Fixing Bacillus Species 363",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,359
"In addition, nutrient elements —such as phosphorus, potassium, iron, zinc, and
copper—possess limited mobility in soil and are present in insoluble forms. Several
Bacillus spp.—such as B. circulans , B. megaterium, B. polymyxa , B. subtilis, and
B. sircalmous —reportedly have the potential to produce organic acids (gluconic
acid, citric acid, etc.), which can convert insoluble inorganic phosphate compounds(tricalcium phosphate, dicalcium phosphate, hydroxyapatite, and rock phosphate)into bioavailable phosphorus (Prakash and Arora 2019 ; Saeid et al. 2018 ;
Satyaprakash et al. 2017 ). Like phosphorus, iron is present in the environment in a
form (Fe
3+) that is inaccessible to plants. Some Bacillus spp. provide iron to plants
by chelating it from soil through siderophore production (Wahyudi et al. 2011 ; Liu

erties, some Bacillus spp. can also help get rid of fungal pathogens by secreting cell
wall–degrading enzymes.
18.5 Bacillus Species as Plant Protectors
Bacillus and Paenibacillus spp. work as plant protectors either directly by
suppressing phytopathogens or producing various cell wall –degrading and antifun-
gal metabolites, or indirectly by eliciting induced systemic resistance (ISR) against
pathogens in plants. B. subtilis is one of the most prominent bacteria in this regard
and been explored for its antagonistic properties against fungal phytopathogens foruse as a biocontrol agent in agriculture (Xie et al. 2020 ; Asaka and Shoda 1996 ;

18.6 Conclusion
Chemical fertilizers, which are now used frequently in a quest for high crop yields to
fulﬁll the needs of the growing human population, are an ongoing matter of
discussion because of environmental concerns and fears for consumer health. There-
fore, there has recently been growing interest in environmentally friendly and
sustainable agricultural practices. Although Rhizobium is a great nitrogen ﬁxer, its
selective host range and limiting factors, such as nodule formation, have prompted asearch for other nitrogen- ﬁxing microbes. Many other bacteria that exhibit such
activities have now been reported. Nitrogen- ﬁxing properties, along with different
plant growth –promoting properties and a wide host range, make Bacillus spp.",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,361
"activities have now been reported. Nitrogen- ﬁxing properties, along with different
plant growth –promoting properties and a wide host range, make Bacillus spp.
suitable for this purpose. Because of their spore-forming capability, they are readilyadaptable to ﬁeld applications and can resist a wide range of environmental stresses.
Additionally, a lot of genomic research has already been done on Bacillus species,
which can be further explored through application of biotechnology to developimproved transgenic strains that have manifold mechanisms of action and strainswith precise formulation qualities. Endophytic colonization and bio ﬁlm formation
are two of the most desirable characteristics for prospective biofertilizers andbiocontrol agents. As studies have shown, Bacillus spp. possess these properties18 Perspectives on Nitrogen-Fixing Bacillus Species 365",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,361
"and can be used as biofertilizers and biocontrol agents, which may be self-
perpetuating within colonized host plants. Although many Bacillus spp. with poten-
tial for nitrogen ﬁxation have been identi ﬁed, the underlying mechanisms are still
being investigated in ongoing research and should be con ﬁrmed in the future. To
achieve sustainable crop yields in agriculture, application of Bacillus and
Paenibacillus can notably decrease use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides, and
maintain the fertility of soil.

Abstract Bacteria have cell communication in a population density dependent type
which involves the production of pheromone like molecule called autoinducer.
When a bacterial cell grows in population, the intracellular signals regulate differ-
ential gene expression which leads to speci ﬁc behaviours. Primarily plants have the
narrow recognizable range for low molecular weight nitrogen component, hence are
dependent on products release through N-mineralization such as ammonia and
nitrate for biomolecule production. Diazotrophic bacteria release signalling mole-
cule like AHL (Acyl-homoserine lactone) which is involved in communication

"19.1 Introduction
The population density of soil microbiota present in the rhizosphere has a signi ﬁcant
effect on enhancing the level of plant nutrition and regulating the strength of roots.
Therefore the ﬁnal above ground level growth of plants is controlled by the biodi-
versity of microbiota present in the rhizosphere (Bais et al. 2006 ). In the last few
decades, it has been recognizing that in the rhizosphere there is a cross-talk andexchange of molecules between soil ﬂora and micro-organisms surrounding the root
surface. These complex signalling molecules consist of distinct types of cell signal-ling pathways which are forming a hidden network, that manipulate and control thephysiological process, like the formation of bio ﬁlm, symbiosis defense between ﬂora
and microorganisms (Waters and Bassler 2005 ). Bacteria have cell communication

in a population density dependent type which involves the production of
pheromone-like molecule called autoinducer. When a bacterial cell grows in popu-lation, the intracellular signals regulate differential gene expression which leads tospeciﬁc behaviours (Fuqua et al. 1994 ). The process of QS occurs in sequential
order, ﬁrstly bacterial cell production and release biochemical pheromones in sur-
rounding habitat and secondly recognition of autoinducer by the speci ﬁc receptor
which leads to change in gene regulation of receptor (Red ﬁeld2002 ). The best

spp. can perform biological nitrogen ﬁxation by forming nodulation in association
with a plant. These both strains have complex QS system involving different chainsfor the synthesis of AHL (Braekenetal.2008). This review gives a glimpse about themolecular and mechanistic role of QS autoinducers involved in a symbiotic rela-tionship with the plant for nitrogen ﬁxation (Table 19.1).
19.2 How Bacteria Talk to each Other
Many reviews have described features like how quorum sensing is cell density
dependent activity and involves autoinducers. Some information have reported onplant-associated bacteria showing quorum sensing mechanism. There are two classesof plant-associated bacteria linked with quorum sensing gene, one which is legume372 M. Saraf and S. Sharma",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,367

19.2.1 Synthesis and Regulator of AHL Compound
AHL synthases are mediated by two known protein family. The ﬁrst group is LuxI
type protein which is identical to P.ﬁscheri. This group of the enzyme also catalyzes
the ligation process of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) with an acylated acyl carrier
protein forming an HSL as a resulting component of AHL (Moré et al. 1996 ;
Schaefer et al. 1996 ; Fuqua et al. 1994 ; Withers et al. 2001 ). The second group of
protein is LuxM/AinS-type. The product of ainsgene from P.ﬁscheri andluxM gene

The AHL based bioreporters had made feasible to understand the mechanism of QS
in diverse bacteria. Though there is a wide range of reports exists, two of them havegiven focused for complete insights like Agrobacterium tumefaciens and
Chromobacterium violaceum. With the help of thin layer chromatography both the
model and the organism have been used for detection of AHL. The A. tumefaciens
does not produce its bioreporters, instead of that, it initiates the traG:lacZ fusion
which leads to TraR a homologue to LuxR. This type of AHL reporter is bit sensitiveand can detect a low amount of AHL in the environment (Shaw et al. 1997 ). Whereas

production of purple pigment violacein is mediated by QS genes cviI/cviR .A
C. violaceum (cviI) mutant is inadequate to produce any AHL but was able to
produce pigment in the response of any external AHLs or a component that mimics
AHL. It can produce any short chain AHLS up to the length of C4 to C8 (McCleanet al. 1997 ).
19.2.3 AHL Degradation
In the rhizospheric environment when AHL producing microbiota in communities
interact with microorganisms which are pro ﬁcient of degrading AHL, produce
signals and get involved in quorum sensing. Those enzymes which degrade AHLare categorized either based on bacterial spp. in which they are found or their modeof action (Zhang et al. 2007 ). These enzymes are signi ﬁcantly either belongs to",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,369

initiates degrading AHL molecule which hinders signal turnover. The gamma-butyrolactones act as a natural substrate for AttM and can hinder the expression ofattM genes found in rhizobacteria (Carlier et al. 2004 ).
19.3 The Symbiotic Bacteria Interact through Nodulation
One of the best studied interactions is between legumes and diazotrophic bacteria
which involves the signalling process back and forth from the host plant. The signalis initiated by the plants from the release of ﬂavonoid molecule which stimulate374 M. Saraf and S. Sharma",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,369

atoms. Perhaps it has not been demonstrated that Nod factor binds to these receptorsare having LysM domain (Jones et al. 2008 ; Madsen et al. 2010 ). When the alfalfa

stimulates an ion ﬂow across the plant plasma membrane and as a result of depolar-

The various biochemical and genetically conducted experiments had developedsome approaches to studying high af ﬁnity binding sites for Nod factor receptor in
legumes. One of them is located at the plasma membrane of alfalfa cells, namelyNFBS2 which binds to S.meliloti . At high af ﬁnity binding region, NFBS2 binds to

"19.4 Role of the Plasmid in Signalling Symbiosis
The archetype to study quorum sensing based plasmid transfer was investigated in
the bacteria A. tumefaciens which carries transfer of Ti plasmid in the plant which
result in the production of opines (Zhu et al. 2000 ). When the bacteria are at late
exponential phase and reach maximum population density, in the presence of opine,bacteria induce the plasmid transfer gene through Ti plasmid. This mode of action ispossible due to the activity of the regulator TraR. This regulator is transcriptionallypromoted by opines and generated by aggregation of 3-oxo-c8-HSL produced by

"TraI (Zhang et al. 1993 ; Piper et al. 1993 ). A crystallized form of TraR bound to
AHL has been developed and it has proved that AHL is a necessary component thatbinds to dimers of TraR. This kind of bounding system is much more stable toproteolytic degradation rather than TraR is not bound to AHL (Zhu and Winans1999 ). The product of traM gene governs the positive feedback of TraR and AHL

of information for plasmid on a speci ﬁc chromosome. The successful horizontal
transfer of plasmid containing multiple information from nitrogen- ﬁxing enriched

group of plasmid which is not identi ﬁed yet functionally but is having similar

therefore, activation of sinIis effected by SinR. There was a huge difference in the
production of AHL, when made by SinI (Marketon et al. 2002 ). When sinIdepen-

regulation of ExpR gene, there have been more than seventy ﬁve proteins are
identi ﬁed that were expressing AHL made by SinI regulatory system and AHL
accumulation has been responsible for the expression of sixty other proteins. How-ever strain 1021 lacks ExpR functions, the expression of 135 proteins is due to direct

nodulation and symbiotic plasmid transfer (Wisniewski-Dyé and Downie 2002 ).

"19.6 Quorum Sensing Signalling in Free Living
Diazotrophs
The quorum sensing in free living diazotrophic bacteria has not discussed much
because of their low popularity but there are few experiments conducted showingevidence to increase the nitrogen content of plant in response to quorum sensing. Inecosystem, plants have limited absorption capacity of nutrition from soil becausethey lack the functional activity to convert nitrogen of high molecular weight to lowmolecular weight. When quorum sensing having bacteria inoculated in ﬁeld they
form bio ﬁlm and perform subsequential conversion of atmospheric nitrogen to the
available form of amino acids and ammonia. There was an increase in the amount of
dissolved nitrogen content of paddy ﬁeld when treated with diazotrophic bacteria,
producing extracellular enzymes and extent quorum sensing behaviour (Guo et al.2012 ; Liu et al. 2013 ; Zhou et al. 2014 ). The experiment conducted by Santos Lima",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,378

related to the synthesis of AHL in A. lipoferum TVV3. Both the genes alpI and
alpR were found to belong to LuxI and LuxR families and when cloned in suitable
host, were able to synthesize a different type of AHL. However, it was noticed thatthese genes are not homologous to all the strains of Azospirillum spp. These genes
show characteristics only in few strain of Azospirillum .19 Quorum Sensing Enhances Nitrogen Uptake in Plant 383",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,378
"19.7 Conclusion
There are many experiments conducted on how rhizobacteria utilize these signalling
behaviours to interact with plant, which leads to some major bene ﬁcial modi ﬁcation
to enhance plant growth. Quorum sensing has gained attraction in many perspectivesto study the biochemical reaction and gene resolution of rhizobacteria in response toplants. Since many years Rhizobium spp. has been consider a model organism to
study molecular pinning involved in nitrogen ﬁxation. Majority of Rhizobium spp.
like Mesorhizoboium, Sinorhizobium, Rhizobium etli, Bradyrhizobium involves
distinct mechanism and different types of gene regulation to induce quorum sensing.
Many nonpathogenic bacteria have shown their involvement in the metabolic pro-
cess like nitrogen ﬁxation, exopolysaccharide production though production of
autoinducer like AHL (Gao et al. 2005 ). Despite inducing genes like cinI,sinI,
rhiI, other environmental factors may also play a role in regulating quorum sensing",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,379
"autoinducer like AHL (Gao et al. 2005 ). Despite inducing genes like cinI,sinI,
rhiI, other environmental factors may also play a role in regulating quorum sensing
system. Nodulation study has been one of the easiest and convenient way toemphasize the role of quorum sensing in nitrogen ﬁxation.
19.8 Future Prospective
Although many rhizobacteria have reported for manipulating symbiotic signalling
with plants, only a few of them are practically applied. Many reports have explainedthe nodulation process through quorum sensing but a detailed correlation between
nifH cluster and quorums sensing has not been focused yet. Apparently, some free
living diazotrophs are also capable of inducing gene expression through quorumsensing system. However very few strains like Azospirillum brasilense ,
Gluconacetobacter diazotrophicus ,and Klebsiella NG14 have been ef ﬁciently
involved in nitrogen ﬁxation through quorum sensing mechanism. Quorum sensing",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,379
"Gluconacetobacter diazotrophicus ,and Klebsiella NG14 have been ef ﬁciently
involved in nitrogen ﬁxation through quorum sensing mechanism. Quorum sensing
is depended on another mechanism like EPS production and bio ﬁlm formation. In
future, there should be more focus on investigating quorum sensing signalling in freeliving diazotrophs and plants in the rhizosphere. AHL produced by the S. meliloti has
signiﬁcantly affected the senescence of nodulation.

Fungi and Nitrogen Cycle: Symbiotic
Relationship, Mechanism and Signi ﬁcance
Mani Singh
Abstract Fungi are integral components of any natural ecosystem and play a
signiﬁcant role in maintaining nitrogen cycle. Nitrogen is the essential constituent
of any organisms as several biomolecules like proteins and nucleic acids are made up
of nitrogen. As such nitrogen caters to the requirements of different species at
different trophic levels of the ecosystem through its various compounds formed in
a nitrogen cycle. Like other microbes, fungi form different symbiotic relationship
with plants in which they get carbon inputs from plants in return of nitrogenous and
other nutrients. This chapter explains the role of fungi in nitrogen cycle and explores
their molecular mechanism. While the ﬁrst half of nitrogen cycle is led by bacteria,
the second half is undoubtedly led by fungi. The major fungal genes involved are",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,385

20.1 Introduction
Nitrogen is an essential element for all living organisms including plants, animals
and microbes. It is essentially required by the organism in the formation of proteins,
nucleic acids and other nitrogenous compounds. Atmospheric nitrogen is the ulti-

"fertilizers (added by man) and rocks dissolute by water act as other sources of
nitrates for the plants. The lightening energy helps combine the nitrogen and oxygento form atmospheric nitrates, which settle down to the earth through the rain. In
factory setup it requires high energy and pressure to form nitrogenous fertilizers.
Alternatively, nitrogen ﬁxation is done by the microbes which facilitate almost 90%
of the nitrogen ﬁxation.
20.2 Nitrogen Cycle and Microbes
Nitrogen is found in inorganic (ammonia, nitrate) and organic (amino and nucleic
acids) forms besides the elemental form. The nitrogen undergoes different trans-formations in nitrogen cycle. These transformational changes as different com-pounds of nitrogen are very important phenomenon in the biosphere that is
responsible for high productivity of the ecosystem. Nitrogen ﬁxation, nitri ﬁcation,
denitri ﬁcation, anammox and ammoni ﬁcation are major steps of nitrogen cycle
(Fig. 20.1 and20.2).

bacteria. NH 3is oxidized to the NO 2/C0and then to the NO 3/C0by nitrifying bacteria
and becomes bioavailable to the plants. Some part of this nitrate gets converted to theatmospheric nitrogen by the denitrifying bacteria and fungi. The whole process
constitutes Nitrogen Cycle, where microbes play signi ﬁcant job in maintaining the
cycle (Fig. 20.1).

Nitrogen ﬁxation is the conversion of molecular or atmospheric nitrogen into form
utilizable to plant by nitrogen ﬁxing microorganisms using an enzyme system called
nitrogenase. This is also known as Biological Nitrogen Fixation (BNF). BNFincludes both symbiotic nitrogen ﬁxation and the free living nitrogen ﬁxing system.

20.2.2 Nitri ﬁcation
Nitriﬁcation is the biological oxidation of ammonia to nitrite followed by the
oxidation of the nitrite to nitrate. It completes in two steps. Ammonium oxidation

Many other ammonia oxidizing archaea have been found to be abundant in ocean,soils and salt marshes. These archaea act as ammonia oxidizing organism. Oxidation
of nitrite into nitrate is the second step in nitri ﬁcation and is mostly carried out by
nitrogen oxidizing bacteria (prokaryotes). Example of these bacteria is Nitrospira,
nitrobacter, nitrococcus andNitrospina. It involves the following steps:

Besides aerobic nitri ﬁcation, anoxic or anaerobic nitri ﬁcation of ammonia also
occurs (Strous et al. 1999 ) that is called Anammox (anaerobic ammonia oxidation).
Members of planctomycetes phylum of bacteria carry out anammox and use nitrite
as the electron acceptor to produce gaseous nitrogen.
InAmmoni ﬁcation, decomposition of excretory products or bodies of animals and
human takes place by various fungi and prokaryotes that release inorganic nitrogenback into the ecosystem as ammonia. This makes ammonia available for uptake byplants and other microorganisms. Ammoni ﬁcation is followed by denitri ﬁcation
process.
20.2.3 Denitri ﬁcation

otes (fungi) are also capable of denitri ﬁcation. The denitri ﬁers require mostly
organic carbon and are called chemo-organotrophs. Denitri ﬁcation releases nascent
nitrogen back into atmosphere that completes the nitrogen cycle. Many other studieshave also mentioned that fungal denitri ﬁcation is a major process of the nitrogen
cycle (Laughlin and Stevens 2002 ,M ae ta l . 2008 , Sutka et al. 2008 , Cathrine and

Anthropogenic activities since mid-1990s have spiked the release of N 2in the

nitrogen into the ecosystem will be high enough to be consumed by the microbialnitrogen ﬁxation. The increased environmental nitrogen may have an adverse impact
on primary productivity of the ecosystem (Galloway et al. 1994 ).

Microbes are the key components of any ecosystem. Apart from nitrogen ﬁxing
bacteria, many other microbes (bacteria, archaea bacteria and various fungi) are

"20.3 Bacteria Vs Fungi: Role in Nitrogen Cycle
Similar to bacteria, fungi also contribute signi ﬁcantly in nitrogen cycle from decom-
position to denitri ﬁcation. Earlier, nitrogen ﬁxation was suggested in most kind of
mycorrhizal systems, however now it is accepted that only prokaryotic organismscanﬁx atmospheric nitrogen and that ecto- and endo-mycorrhizal fungi lack this
capacity. Though, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) are known to help enhancethe nitrogen ﬁxing capacity of bacteria like Rhizobia andAzospirillum in rhizosphere
(Biró et al. 1999 , Michael et al. 2000 ). At least 21 AMF spp. have been found in
symbiotic interactions with nitrogen ﬁxing bacteria (MiguelBarea and Azcon et al.
1992 ). The fungal species involved in decomposition of dead organic materials free

The process of denitri ﬁcation of nitrogen cycle was previously thought to be
restricted to bacteria only but in later years the dominant role of fungi and yeasts(eukaryotes) was established in distinct denitrifying (Shoun and Tanimoto 1991 ,

as nitric oxide reductase (P450nor) is the most characteristic component of fungaldenitri ﬁcation system (Nakahara et al. 1993 ; Takaya and Shoun 2000 ). According to
Shoun et al. ( 2012 ) fungal denitri ﬁcation system comprises NirK (copper containing
nitrite reductase) and P450nor (cytochrome P450 nitric oxide reductase) to reduce
nitrite to nitrous oxide.
20.4 Fungi as Symbionts
Fungi undertake denitri ﬁcation in symbiotic and nonsymbiotic manners. Mycorrhi-
zae are structures formed by the association of fungi and plant roots. Mycorrhizamay be categorized as ectotrophic, endotrophic and extendotrophic mycorrhizae.Mycorrhiza increases nutrient absorption from soil which is supplied to the plants ininstalments. The movement of minerals from the fungi to the plants is a metaboli-
cally controlled process.",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,390
"cally controlled process.
Widely studied arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) are endotrophic mycorrhi-
zae and are ubiquitous symbionts of all groups of plants. AMF can improve plantnitrogen acquisition, though have a limited ability to access organic nitrogen.Nonetheless, the synergistic relationship among AMF, Rhizophagus irregularis
and soil microbial communities doubles the nitrogen acquisition that mycorrhizal396 M. Singh",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,390
"plants acquire from organic matter. This increase in nitrogen acquisition is tenfolds
when compared to non-mycorrhizal plants grown in the absence of soil microbialcommunities (Hestrin et al. 2019 ).
AMF –plant symbiotic association which is found in majority of land plants can
reduce the N
2O emission from the soil by decline in nirk gene functions. This
association increases nosZ activities which consume N 2O, thus the AMF –plant
association alters N 2O emission from the soil (Bender et al. 2014 ). Intense agricul-
tural practices destroy AMF associated with plants. This may lead to the increasedsoil N
2O emission due to fungal denitri ﬁcation and co-denitri ﬁcation in the agricul-
tural lands, pastures and forest soil (Phillips et al. 2016 , Rex et al. 2019 ). Acid rain

"declines soil nutrients, amoA gene abundance and gene functions of bacteria and

as an alternative to the chemical fertilizers. The application of biofertilizercontaining mycorrhizal fungi and bacterial species promotes the plant growth. Theresults of this biofertilizer application were matching to the organic as well as thechemical fertilizers. Such biofertilizers improve organic and nitrogen content in soiland enhance the nutritional assimilation of plants (total N, P and K) also (Wu et al.

association of termites and fungi is another example of nitrogen ﬁxation (Sapountzis
et al. 2016 ). Termites ful ﬁl their nitrogen requirements by using atmospheric N 2
ﬁxing capacity of diazotrophic bacteria. Fungus-growing termites (subfamily
Macrotermitinae) host a fungal exosymbiont ( Termitomyces ) that provides digestive
services and the food source for the termites. This has been thought to obviate the
need for N 2-ﬁxation by bacterial symbionts. Thus fungi have a distinct and varied
role in nitrogen cycle.

"Microbial pathways of nitri ﬁcation, denitri ﬁcation and co-denitri ﬁcation produce

process which involves conversion of nitrate or nitrite into N 2O in low concentration
of oxygen insuf ﬁcient to support aerobic respiration. The other one is
co-denitri ﬁcation in which a hybrid N2O and N2 formation occurs with the associ-
ation of two different nitrogen atoms coming from two different nitrogen sources.
Co-denitri ﬁcation gives hybrid N 2O through the reaction of N-donor like NH4+,
NH 2OH, phenylalanine and glycine with a nitrosyl compound (Rex et al. 2019 ). A
pasture soil having high concentration of urea witnesses co-denitri ﬁcation via
multiple pathways like formation of N 2O from anyone of the nitrogen sources20 Fungi and Nitrogen Cycle: Symbiotic Relationship, Mechanism and Signi ﬁcance 397",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,391
"such as ammonium ion, glycine, phenylalanine and NH 2OH. Among these,
co-denitri ﬁcation in the presence of NH 2OH is the dominant process when there is
a high concentration of urea-N in pasture soil due to lots of urine patches.
Bacterial denitri ﬁcation is a function of anaerobic respiration. The molecular
mechanism of bacterial denitrifying system is well characterized (Berks et al.1995 , Zumft 1997 and Ferguson 1998 ). The denitrifying system of bacteria consists
of four reducing steps catalysed by speci ﬁc assimilatory genes (Fig. 20.3).
Characterization of the fungal denitri ﬁcation system reveals that many fungi
(Eukaryotes) perform speci ﬁc denitrifying activities due to the presence of denitri-
ﬁcation system possessing nirk and p 450nor genes. NirK is a copper containing
nitrite reductase and P 450nor a member of CYP family, a cytochrome P450 nitric
oxide (NO) reductase (Nor). Both enzymes reduce nitrite to nitrous oxide (N
2O)",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,392
"nitrite reductase and P 450nor a member of CYP family, a cytochrome P450 nitric

tioning during anaerobic respiration (Fig. 20.4).
Dissimilatory and assimilatory nitrate reductase has also been used by some of the
fungal system. Phylogenetic analysis establishes the ancestral relationship between
bacteria and fungi in regard to NirK gene (Shoun et al. 2012 ). The horizontal transfer

possesses 40% similar sequence to the bacterial CYP105 of actinomycetes. Hencefungi are supposed to have acquired the P450nor from actinomycetes throughhorizontal transfer (Kizawa et al. 1991 ). P450nor is a haem protein and possesses
lypooxygenase activity along with properties of P450 (Shoun et al. 1983 ). Cyto-
chrome P450nor gets electrons from nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) toreduce NO to N
2O. The mechanism of the electron transfer from nicotinamide

researchers (Shoun et al. 2012 , Higgins et al. 2016 , Phillips et al. 2016 , Rex et al.
2019 ). The ability of P450nor to receive two energy electrons of NADH is against
the central dogma of physiological electron transfer because it does not require aredox partner like usual P450 reductase (Fig. 20.5). P450nor is found both in
mitochondria and cytoplasm of the fungal cells. P450nor A1 gives two isoformsP450norA and P450norB. Formation of P450norA from ﬁrst initiation codon of gene
450nor localizes it to mitochondria and second initiation codons restrict norB tocytoplasm (Shoun et al. 2012 ).
Continuous and extensive studies have given a clear picture of the reaction
mechanism of P450nor. The overall reaction has a very rapid turnover,i.e. 1000 s

et al. 2006 ). Most of the fungal denitri ﬁcation system consists of Nirk andP450nor .
These two genes are essential to ensure fungal denitri ﬁcation. Some exceptional
fungi like F. oxysporium and C. tonkinense use dNar/aNar for denitri ﬁcation of
nitrate. Substantially the Nirk and dNar are connected to mitochondrial respiratory
chain which synthesizes ATP. This phenomenon is supposed to be the ﬁrst example

drion, which possess Nirk-type dNir (Kim et al. 2009 ). The horizontal transfer of
P450nor from bacteria to fungi and substitution of Serene (S73 and S75) with
Glycine (G73 and G75) in the gene is the possible reason for the modi ﬁed properties
of usual monooxygenase nature of P450 gene to give Nor activity because P450noris restricted to fungi only (Shoun et al. 2012 ). The stereospeci ﬁc transfer of electrons
from NADH to haem of P450nor makes the gene unique to fungi. This gene mayalso catalyse codenitri ﬁcation reactions in fungus. It also exhibits NADH-peroxidase

Co-denitri ﬁcation usually goes along with fungal denitri ﬁcation. It is a process of

atom comes from nitrite and another one comes from different nitrogen donors(organic nitrogen compound, amine, imines, etc.). The denitri ﬁcation and

electron donor because nitrogen donor also acts as a reducing agent for NO reduc-
tion. This suggests that NO is a direct reactant rather than nitrite in co-denitri ﬁcation.
Co-denitri ﬁcation starts with reduction of nitrite into NO by dNir (Nirk) followed by
denitri ﬁcation of NO to N 2O catalysed by P450nor.
Soil type and characters also play an important role in determination of occur-
rence of co-denitri ﬁcation or denitri ﬁcation or both. A typical denitri ﬁcation path-

Fungi not only have bene ﬁcial symbiotic relationship with the plants forming
mycorrhiza with the roots, but it also plays direct role in main steps of nitrogencycle through denitri ﬁcation and nitrogen ﬁxation. Co-denitri ﬁcation is the parallel
process to denitri ﬁcation in the nitrogen cycle in which two atoms of nitrogen come
from different sources of nitrogen forming a hybrid N
2O and N 2.
Fungi have major contribution in denitri ﬁcation than bacteria and play dominant
role in the soil emission of greenhouse gas N 2O (Laughlin and Stevens 2002 ).
Denitrifying soil bacteria contain nitrogen dioxide reductase gene (nosZ) which
converts N 2O to N2. Though, fungi lack this gene, they are able to perform
denitri ﬁcation and co-denitri ﬁcation in various types of soils using nitric oxide",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,396

"denitri ﬁcation process taking place in agricultural ﬁelds. According to Erisman et al.
(2013 ) the process of denitri ﬁcation in the soil and sediments is a very important
ecosystem service which has positive impact on the water quality, however at thesame time it is harmful to the stratospheric ozone. N
2O is a potent greenhouse gas
and acts as a precursor of two different reactions which lead to depletion ofstratospheric Ozone (Ravishankara et al. 2009 ).
Fungi do not possess nitrous oxide reductase (nosZ) gene as found in bacteria
(Shoun et al. 2012 ). This gene reduces N
2Ot oN 2.Therefore fungi give N 2Oa sa n
end product of denitri ﬁcation in place of N 2in the case of bacteria. P450 catalyses
the assimilation and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in Hypocreale and Eurotialeorders of fungi. These substrates are biogenic byproducts of industrial processes(Huarte-Bonnet et al. 2018 ). According to Huarte-Bonnet et al. the family CYP52",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,396
"does the ﬁrst step that is hydroxylation in assimilation process of alkyl hydrocarbons
whereas the family CYP53 is associated with oxidation process of poly aromatichydrocarbons. Thus these fungal species have a great potential of bioremediation of
oilspills and other types of pollutions.
Co-denitri ﬁcation also contributes in the introduction of N
2O and N2 in the
atmosphere. Thus denitri ﬁcation and co-denitri ﬁcation both dominantly accom-
plished by the soil fungi lead to the release of organic and inorganic nitrogen tothe atmosphere in the form of nitrous oxide and nitrogen gas. This maintains thenitrogen cycle which is very important for a balanced and sustainable ecosystem.402 M. Singh",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,396
"Laughlin and Stevens ( 2002 ) observed the domination of fungal co-denitri ﬁcation in
hybrid N 2formation due to depletion of NO 3/C0where 92% of N 2O evolved was
co-denitri ﬁcation driven.
Therefore it can be concluded that apart from the synergistic relationship of
mycorrhiza which supplies phosphorus to the soil microbiome, many of the fungalgenera play a crucial role in the release of biological nitrogen in the forms of N
2and
N2O gases into the atmosphere. The fungi act as a regulatory unit for the nitrogen
cycle.
20.7 Conclusion
Fungi play a crucial role in nitrogen cycle. Though some of the fungal species alsoact as a nitrogen ﬁxers and nitri ﬁers but mainly they play a major role in denitri ﬁ-
cation and co-denitri ﬁcation. dNar, aNar ,Nirk and P450nor are the main genes

Fungal species use aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons as substrate for nitrogen
uptake. Therefore they act as bioremediators for the removal of poly aromatichydrocarbons and aliphatic pollutants. Better understanding and commercial appli-cations of the knowledge will help reduce the dependence on chemical inputs in theform of fertilizer and pesticides which will be a step towards a sustainable ecosys-tem. New study techniques and genomic research are required to unravel the mystery

accurate assessment of fungal contributions to co-denitri ﬁcation too. The molecular
mechanism of denitri ﬁcation is almost explored and explained. There is a need of
elaborated information on the molecular mechanism of co-denitri ﬁcation.

Abstract Nitrogen (N) is an important macronutrient that has a signi ﬁcant role in
plant growth and development. Therefore, optimum levels of N should be supplied
to the plants for sustainable crop production. Besides the chemical fertilization of
plants, bene ﬁcial soil microorganisms like the arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi
form a mutualistic association with the majority of plant roots and enhance plant
growth and nutrient uptake. The importance of AM fungi is mostly attributed to
phosphorus (P) acquisition in plants. Nevertheless, the role of AM fungi in the N
nutrition of plants is also well known. Plants N acquisition is mediated by direct and
indirect pathways through plant roots or via a common mycelium network of AM",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,401

to dinitrogen (N 2)ﬁxation in plants. This chapter highlights the role of AM fungi in
N nutrition, N 2ﬁxation, and uptake of organic and inorganic N from the soils. Also,
the importance of AM fungi in the N cycle and the impact of different AM fungal

"pollution and also leads to the degradation of natural resources (Fan et al. 2011 ). The
growth and development of crop plants basically rely on the combination andconcentration of nutrients existing in the soil solution. The signi ﬁcant challenge
for plants is to acquire adequate quantities of these mineral nutrients essential for
their basic cellular process and development from the soil. This is caused mainly dueto the immobile nature of plants as well as the large number of essential mineralnutrients including both macro- and micronutrients required for their growth andsustenance (Morgan and Connolly 2013 ).
Among the various macronutrients, nitrogen (N) forms an integral part of the
plant body as it constitutes around 3 –4% of plant dry weight (Tang et al. 2018 ). Also,

"N becomes a limiting factor for plant growth and yield in certain conditions and it
inﬂuences the development of leaves, formation, and functioning of chlorophyll and
is a major constituent of amino acids (Ueda et al. 2017 ). Therefore, N is a vital
component in agricultural fertilization for any crop species (Torres-Olivar et al.2014 ). In fact, Gojon ( 2017 ) suggested that the quantity of N fertilizers used in
agriculture is enormous and nearly equals the natural global dinitrogen (N
2)ﬁxation
into the bio-lithosphere from the atmosphere. The source of N for plants in the soil isavailable as a complex mixture of organic and inorganic compounds (Christou et al.2006 ). Plants generally take up inorganic forms of N mostly nitrate (NO
3/C0) and
ammonium (NH 4+) from the soil (Hawkins and Robbins 2010 ). Nevertheless, some
studies have shown that amino acids are used as a primary source of N in certainplant species (Inselsbacher and Näsholm 2012 ; Dion et al. 2018 ). Moreover, plants",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,402
"studies have shown that amino acids are used as a primary source of N in certainplant species (Inselsbacher and Näsholm 2012 ; Dion et al. 2018 ). Moreover, plants

The nutrient transport in plants not only involves the unique transport system
present on the root epidermis but also the nutrient transport system imparted byparticular soil microbial communities (Kobae 2019 ). Arbuscular mycorrhizal
(AM) fungi are ubiquitous soil-borne microorganisms associating with nearly
60–70% of land plants (Smith and Read 2008 ). These fungi have a pivotal role in
natural and agricultural ecosystems through their in ﬂuence on plant nutritional status

"by altering the soil ’s biological activity and availability of nutrients to plants (Smith
and Read 2008 ; Ingraf ﬁa et al. 2019 ). It has been estimated that plants assimilate
more than 50% of their total N through mycorrhizal symbiosis regardless of the hosttype (Veresoglou et al. 2012 ). The extraradical mycelia (ERM) of AM fungi in the
soil forms a common mycelial network interconnecting the roots of almost all the
plants existing in a plant community (He et al. 2019 ). This facilitates the transport of
nutrients such as phosphorus (P), C, N, and other nutrients between multiple planthosts and also permits the exchange of signals among the AM fungal network ininterconnected plants (Bücking et al. 2016 ).
The ef ﬁcient role of AM fungi in the uptake and transport of P has been well
evidenced in different plant species (Seguel et al. 2015 ; Mackay et al. 2017 ; Ortas

demonstrating the impact of AM fungi on the N uptake in different host plants, theirmechanisms (Table 21.1) are not well deciphered as for plants P acquisition

regarded as natural plant growth regulators and are often used as bio-inoculants orbiofertilizers in sustainable crop production systems (Barrow 2012 ).
The unique structures like arbuscules, and vesicles that are formed by AM fungi
in the plant roots and also spores and hyphae that develop in the soil surroundingroots have different functions (Smith and Read 2008 ; Begum et al. 2019 ). Initially,
the fungal hyphae penetrate the root through the epidermis and extend within plantroots inter- or intracellularly until it reaches the root cortex where it formsarbuscules. The arbuscules are short-lived and are the transit points as they regulatethe nutrient exchange between the fungus and the plant (Bonfante and Genre 2010 ).

"The vesicles are presumed to be storage reserves of minerals and lipids of the fungi
within the plant roots and are utilized by the fungi when their supply from the host
plant is limited (Smith and Read 2008 ). The mycelium is a key component in AM
fungal symbiosis consisting of ERM and intraradical mycelium (IRM). The ERMnetwork in the soil not only helps in accessing the nutrients but also enlarges thesurface area of the roots in the soil thereby promoting plant growth (Bowles et al.2016 ). The ERM takes up nutrients from the soil and transport to the host plant roots,
whereas the IRM liberates the nutrients to apoplast and exchanges C from the hostplant. These C resources are utilized by the fungus to enlarge and maintain ERM, for
thallus metabolisms, and also for spore development (van Aarle and Olsson 2008 ;
Smith and Smith 2011 ).

"Smith and Smith 2011 ).
21.3 Uptake of N by AM Fungi
The roots of AM plants acquire nutrients via two pathways, either through root
epidermis and root hairs directly or by symbiotic interfaces that are provided byarbuscules or hyphal/arbusculate coils formed inside the root cortical cells
(Fig. 21.1; Smith and Smith 2011 ). It has been suggested that the N assimilation
by plants is carried out by mycorrhizal symbiosis regardless of the host type they areassociated with (Veresoglou et al. 2012 ). Nitrogen uptake by AM fungi could be
divided into two major divisions: (1) organic N uptake and (2) inorganic N uptake.
21.3.1 Organic N Uptake
The organic matter present in the soil is the fundamental source of N for plants in
terrestrial ecosystems and maintaining this organic matter is crucial for the sustain-
ability of both natural and agricultural ecosystems (Frey 2019 ). As mentioned",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,407
"terrestrial ecosystems and maintaining this organic matter is crucial for the sustain-
ability of both natural and agricultural ecosystems (Frey 2019 ). As mentioned
previously, AM fungi capture low mobile mineral nutrients that are not availableto the plant roots through their widespread hyphal network that extends beyond thenutrient depletion zone surrounding the roots (Smith et al. 2011 ; Kobae 2019 ).
However, it was believed that AM fungi might play only a minor role in N nutrition21 Arbuscular Mycorrhiza in Sustainable Plant Nitrogen Nutrition: Mechanisms ... 413",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,407
"of plants due to their obligate biotrophic nature and the lack of saprotrophic
capability that is required for obtaining N from organic sources (Smith and Read2008 ). Also, AM fungi do not possess or have the minimum capability to produce
soil hydrolytic enzymes that have the capacity to decompose organic compoundswith high molecular weight (Smith and Smith 2011 ; Phillips et al. 2013 ).
Nevertheless, numerous studies have evidenced the importance of AM fungi in
the uptake of organic N from the soil (Whiteside et al. 2012a ; Bukovsk áet al. 2016 ).
For example, Hodge and Fitter ( 2010 ) in a microcosm experiment raised a pair of
Plantago lanceolata plants both in the presence and absence of AM fungus
Simiglomus hoi (¼Glomus hoi ) that permitted the fungus alone to access organic
patch labelled with

"ERM was enriched with15N, and not with13C con ﬁrming that AM fungi do not
possess any saprophytic capabilities and the fungus obtained15N as a product of
decomposition from the organic patches. In the same experiment, the fungal hyphae
of the AM fungi S. hoi andFunneliformis mosseae (¼Glomus mosseae ) exploited
the organic material and were able to colonize new host plant, thus indicating thefungal growth. Therefore they proposed that AM fungi could proliferate especiallyin organic patches, where they can obtain one-third of N from the decomposingorganic material (Hodge and Fitter 2010 ). The AM fungi could indirectly increase
the mineralization of N from organic matter (Atul-Nayyar et al. 2009 ) through their
effect on the C ﬂow during the decomposition process via soil microbial communi-
ties (Herman et al. 2012 ; Nuccio et al. 2013 ).

The AM fungal spore formation, as well as the establishment of the ERM in the
soil, is mainly facilitated by the organic amendments which are rich in N contentsuch as plant remains, animal manure, and chitin present in the soil (Quilliam et al.2012 ; Bukovsk áet al. 2016 ). The microorganisms in the soil that solely depend upon
the organic matter for their nutrition, liberate nutrients such as N or P from them andgenerate other secondary metabolites. Thus, these secondary metabolites and nutri-ents may also be involved in the AM fungal hyphal response (Bukovsk áet al. 2016 ).
In addition, microorganisms may directly associate with the surface or the
hyphosphere of AM fungi either partially or completely to receive C from the hyphal
exudates (Jansa and Gryndler 2010 ) and these microorganisms degrade the soil",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,409

pounds that are soluble, which stimulate speci ﬁc transcriptional responses in the
ERM. For instance, the ERM of Rhizophagus irregularis (¼Glomus intraradices )
originating from the hairy roots of carrot was able to recognize and respond at thetranscriptional level to the shortfall of N in the culture medium. However, this ability

that the hyphae of AM fungi could detect the presence of organic matter containingdecomposing patches, proliferate inside them and obtain inorganic N. In a study,Tanaka and Yano ( 2005 ) showed that around 75% of N accumulated in the shoots
and roots of maize plants was transported through the hyphae of the AM fungusRhizophagus aggregatus (¼Glomus aggregatum ).
Apart from primary decomposers that catalyse the release of N molecules which
are captured by the microbial cells, some of the microbial grazers like protists or
nematodes in the soil also have a vital role in the acquisition of N by AM fungalhyphae from the organic sources (Bukovsk áet al. 2018 ). These microbial grazers

"Even though soil microbial biota mineralizes organic N into an accessible form
for the plants, they could also concurrently compete for the liberated N. In a recentstudy, Hestrin et al. ( 2019 ) performed an experiment using a grass species
Brachypodium distachyon and revealed that the synergistic effect between the AM
fungus, R. irregularis and soil microbial communities possesses a non-additive
impact on N uptake. These microbial synergies consequently lead to doubling-upof N that were derived from organic matter in mycorrhizal plants and also a tenfoldenhancement in N uptake than the non-mycorrhizal plants raised in soils free ofmicrobial communities. In addition, they also showed that more than 50% of the Nacquired by AM inoculated plants from organic material may be ascertained to thesynergistic effect between AM plants and their associated microbial communities in

2009 ; Whiteside et al. 2012b ). Some of the transcriptome studies have revealed the
expression and upregulation of amino acid transporter genes in the ERM of AMfungi (Tisserant et al. 2012 ). For example, the amino acid permease found in the
fungal membrane of an AM fungus, F. mosseae was found to play an important role
in the initial stages of amino acid acquisition thereby allowing the amino acid uptake
directly from the soil (Cappellazzo et al. 2007 ). The uptake of different types of

uptake of most of the amino acids such as arginine, methionine, histidine, phenyl-alanine, and tryptophan than non-AM plants. They also found that AM fungi
stimulated the uptake of positively and neutrally charged amino acids more than
the amino acids with a negative charge. This clearly shows that AM fungal coloni-zation increases the uptake of organic N through their mycelium and transfers it totheir host plants (Whiteside et al. 2012b ).

"21.3.2 Inorganic N Uptake
Inorganic N sources like NH 4+and NO 3/C0are comparatively available in the soil as
mobile forms, consequently decreasing the ef ﬁcient bene ﬁt to the mycorrhizal plants
for N uptake (Smith and Read 2008 ). Moreover, AM plants often possess higher
nitriﬁcation rates in the ecosystem (Veresoglou et al. 2011 ). However, the limitation
of N can also take place in these ecosystems, and in such a situation, AM fungi couldcontribute to NO
3/C0uptake in a competitive environment and transfer them to the
host plants. Nitrate plays a central role as a N source for crop plants and is more
mobile when compared to ammonium (Gregory 2006 ; Marschner 2011 ). Both NH 4+
and NO 3/C0are captured by the ERM of AM fungi (Hawkins et al. 2000 ). Neverthe-
less, owing to its lower energy cost, NH 4+is commonly preferred than NO 3/C0(Hodge
et al. 2010 ). The uptake of NH 4+through AM symbiosis by plants is ﬁve times",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,411
"less, owing to its lower energy cost, NH 4+is commonly preferred than NO 3/C0(Hodge
et al. 2010 ). The uptake of NH 4+through AM symbiosis by plants is ﬁve times
greater than NH 4+uptake by the plants themselves (Tian et al. 2010 ). In addition, the
environmental conditions also affect the form of inorganic N taken up by the plants.For instance, it is familiar that uptake of NO
3/C0is more sensitive than NH 4+at low
temperature. On contrary, AM fungal hyphae may have enhanced access to N in the
less mobile form NH 4+and uptake this form of N through its extensive ERM
network before its conversion into NO 3/C0(Hodge and Storer 2015 ).
According to Fellbaum et al. ( 2012b ), the inorganic N forms NH 4+and NO 3/C0
taken up by the ERM are converted into arginine and then to polyphosphates. The
polyphosphates are then transported into the IRM which are again converted toarginine (Cruz et al. 2007 ). The arginine in the IRM is then converted to urea and

"polyphosphates are then transported into the IRM which are again converted toarginine (Cruz et al. 2007 ). The arginine in the IRM is then converted to urea and
then to NH

in the IRM is translocated into the plant root cortex. In root organ cultures, carrot
roots colonized with AM fungi had signi ﬁcantly higher glutamine synthetase and
glutamate dehydrogenase activities than non-mycorrhizal plantlets (Toussaint et al.2004 ). The plant biomass, densities of AM fungal hyphae, and transport of N to the
plants through the fungal hyphae were lower when NH

mycorrhizal plants when compared to those supplied with NO 3/C0along with NH 4+

Besides, 23% of inorganic N absorbed by the mycorrhizal fungi was reserved in the

the fungus and then to plant root cortical cells (Vangelisti et al. 2018 ; Xu et al. 2019 ).
The extraradical fungal hyphae can also directly assimilate NH 4+,N O 3/C0, and amino
acids from the external medium (Basu et al. 2018 ). In the N cycle, mycorrhizal fungi
transfer the soil N into the plant cells via the arbuscules (Vergara et al. 2019 ). Thus,
in addition to N translocation (Klironomos et al. 2005 ; Leifheit et al. 2014 ) AM fungi
also enhance N use ef ﬁciency (NUE) and equalize extra N fertilization (Rosolem
et al. 2017 ). The establishment of AM fungi –plant symbiosis takes place by the
release of fungal ‘Myc factors ’and plant root exudates (Basu et al. 2018 ).

with AM fungi to the non-symbiotic N 2ﬁxing microorganisms under the low N

ERM from the soil is incorporated into the ERM of R. irregularis through the
GS-GOGAT pathway as revealed through mRNA determination and quantitativereal-time PCR techniques (Govindarajulu et al. 2005 ). The bidirectional transport
and breakdown of arginine by the AM fungus R. irregularis mycelium associated
with transformed carrot roots was reported by Jin ( 2009 ). The N released from
arginine may be transmitted to the partner plant or used to biosynthesize more aminoacids and nucleotides essential for fungal growth. The arginine is degraded, andtransported as NH

arbusculated cortical cells. Furthermore, Govindarajulu et al. ( 2005 ) showed that
R. irregularis increases NH 4+accessibility in the fungal region and produced NH 4+
during urea degradation in the IRM. These conclusions speci ﬁed that NH 4+is
transferred from IRM to the plant cell. The urea in the IRM is converted to NH 4+
with the help of the urease enzyme. Finally, amino acids are produced from NH 4+

strated by the experiment which recorded that the genes of N incorporated com-
pounds are expressed in the extraradical tissues, and genes linked with arginine
breakdown are mostly expressed in the IRM (Govindarajulu et al. 2005 ).
Numerous studies were conducted on N uptake, translocation, and transfer via
AM fungi through15N isotopic, estimation of enzymes, and investigation of expres-
sions of related genes (Tian et al. 2010 ). The expression of a putative nicotinamide
adenine dinucleotide (NAD)-dependent glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) genelocalized in the ERM tissue was down-regulated when provided with either NO
3/C0
or NH 4+conﬁrming the catabolic role of GDH (Vallorani et al. 2002 ). This suggests
that during C scarcity, NAD-dependent GDH catabolize glutamate to generate C
skeletons to restore the tricarboxylic acid cycle (Jin et al. 2012 ). Jin ( 2009 ) reported418 R. Koshila Ravi et al.",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,412

21.5 Role of AM Fungi in Symbiotic N 2Fixation
Symbiotic N 2ﬁxation is a mutualistic association where plants offer photosynthetic
C and a niche to the bacteria in exchange for ﬁxed N (Sulieman and Tran 2004 ).
Symbiotic N 2ﬁxation is mostly restricted to legumes in agricultural systems and
around 200 species of woody perennials from 20 unrelated genera ofnon-leguminous angiosperms. In the nodular symbiosis, legumes and actinorhizalplants associate with bacteria that stimulate the nodule formation in the roots.

2and supply in the form of ammonia to the plants which can be absorbed easily by
the leguminous plants (Chen and Hicks 2003 ; Masson-Boivin and Sachs 2018 ).
However, the strains of Frankia that associate with the non-leguminous plants in
actinorhizal symbiosis are speci ﬁc to a plant species. The symbiotic bacteria in the
nodules promote the provision for nutrients in legumes and actinorhizal plants andsigniﬁcantly contribute to their N acquisition (Larimer et al. 2014 ). The legumes
(except in the genus Lupinus ) and actinorhizal plants establish simultaneous root
symbiosis with both Rhizobium/Frankia and AM fungi. The synergetic effect among
the root symbionts (AM fungi and Rhizobium /Frankia ) could enhance the nutrient
acquisition and growth in nodulating N
2ﬁxing plants (Hack et al. 2019 ).

As mentioned earlier, in AM colonized plant roots, the fungal hyphae move into
the surrounding rhizosphere soil by forming an extensive hyphal network reachingsoil up to greater volume to obtain the mobile mineral nutrients (Smith and Read2008 ; Molla and Solaiman 2009 ). The in ﬂuence of mixed AM fungal inoculation

2ﬁxation (BNF) of
a forage legume, Melilotus alba treated with Rhizobium meliloti suspension was
analysed (Hack et al. 2019 ). The ﬁndings of the study revealed increased mycorrhi-
zal colonization, plant biomass, nutrient uptake (N and P), and BNF under AMfungal inoculation. Further, the results of the study suggested that AM fungi did notmake any signi ﬁcant impact on plant nutrition and biomass under low soil P",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,413
"availability, regardless of the degree of AM fungal colonization. However, AMsymbiosis positively in ﬂuenced the nutrient accumulation, N uptake, and plant
biomass under high P availability in the soil, which is related to the improved
BNF in M. alba .
Seedlings of Discaria trinervis spot inoculated with Frankia strain BCU110501
and co-inoculated with the AM fungus Gigaspora rosea (BEG 9) had improved
growth and nodulation compared to those inoculated with Frankia alone (Obertello
and Wall 2015 ). Likewise inoculation of Casuarina equisetifolia subsp. equisetifolia
seedlings with AM fungal inoculum originating from Australian and Senegalese21 Arbuscular Mycorrhiza in Sustainable Plant Nitrogen Nutrition: Mechanisms ... 419",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,413
"soils increased the growth and N content of the seedlings (Diagne et al. 2018 ). These
studies clearly shows that AM fungi improve nodulation and N 2ﬁxation in
actinorhizal plants apart from improving plant growth.
Phosphorus is regarded pivotal for nodulation and N 2ﬁxation. This is evident
from studies where P supply was directly related to nodulation and N 2ﬁxation
(Pérez-Fern ández et al. 2017 ; Míguez-Montero et al. 2020 ). Subsequently, the
requirement of P for N 2ﬁxing plants is always higher than those of other plants.
Biological N 2ﬁxation is an expensive process as Chen et al. ( 2014 ) showed that
nodules in soybean accounted for around 11.5 –28.0% of the photosynthetic C
allocated to the belowground organs. Therefore plants tend to avoid this process insoils that are suf ﬁcient in N or P. For instance, shrubby legumes like Cytisus

"multi ﬂorus,Cytisus balansae ,Cytisus scoparius , and Cytisus striatus acquired
their N from inorganic sources when the soils were high in P (Míguez-Monteroet al. 2020 ). Contrarily, in soils where P is de ﬁcient and limiting, the plant growth in
these legumes were forced to rely on BNF and accumulated greater N in the wholeplant (Míguez-Montero et al. 2020 ).
Most of the studies have shown that AM fungi could enhance the symbiotic N

reported improved N 2ﬁxation and higher growth performance in nodulated
(Bradyrhizobium elkanii ) soybean plants and inoculated with AM fungus ( Glomus
macrocarpum ) under P starvation. The AM symbiosis promoted the symbiotic N 2

atmospheric N 2and liberating N as NH 4+ions, thus making N available to the plants
(Mrkovacki and Milic 2001 ). They may also act as mycorrhiza helper bacteria by
improving the environmental conditions for the establishment and occurrence ofAM fungi by hindering antagonists or through the production of growth factors(Frey-Klett et al. 2007 ). Moreover, a concurrent association of AM fungi and
non-symbiotic N
2ﬁxers could have a synergistic effect on plant nutrient uptake
(Sabannavar and Lakshman 2011 ).

promoting compounds (Dal Cortivo et al. 2020 ). Therefore, dual inoculation of AM
fungi with asymbiotic N 2ﬁxer (R. irregularis +A. vinelandii ) also contributes to the
enhancement of the N 2ﬁxation in wheat plants.
21.7 Nitrogen Uptake under Intercropping System

"pathways in the intercropping system (He et al. 2009 ). In the indirect pathway, the N
released from decomposed tissues and also the root exudates released into therhizosphere by legumes is taken up by the roots of cereal plants through soil solution,
whereas, in the direct method, N is imparted between coexisting legumes and cereals
through common mycelium network of the AM fungi (Bahadur et al. 2019 ).
However, the N demand by the receiver (cereal) plant may differ widely. Moreover,decomposition of roots, root exudates that are rich in soluble nitrogenous elements,and root nodules in legume plants could also increase the N content in the rhizo-sphere soil in an intercropping system (Thilakarathna et al. 2016 ). In fababean/maize

system of nearby plants results in the exchange of carbohydrates and essentialmineral nutrients between the plants (Meng et al. 2015 ; Ingraf ﬁa et al. 2019 ). For

Funneliformis caledonium (¼Glomus caledonium ) in rice/mung bean increased the
N uptake by 64% and nodulation by 54% in mung bean under the intercropping
system. Also, 5.4% to 15.7% of total N was transferred from the leaves of mung bean
to the leaves of rice plants in response to AM fungal inoculation (Li et al. 2009 ). In

leading to improvement of growth and yield of both the crops under intercroppingsystem. Similarly, the application of AM fungi ( R. irregularis ) and Rhizobium
(Bradyrhizobium elkanii strain BXYD3) in soybean –maize intercropping system
on N transfer and C allocation revealed that higher growth performance of maize
than soybean was attributed to increased N uptake by maize through commonmycelium network and contributed less C into common mycelium networks whencompared to soybean under co-inoculation conditions (Wang et al. 2016 ).

21.9 Modulation of Plant N Use Ef ﬁciency
The N use ef ﬁciency is de ﬁned as the yield in biomass or grain obtained per unit of
available N provided by the soil and the added N fertilizer. NUE depends upon theability of the plants to take N from the soil as well as its ef ﬁcient utilization in the
production of biomass and grains. However, in spite of a 10-fold increase in Nfertilizer application to cultivated soils worldwide, the overall increase in grain yield
is less than 3-fold (Tilman et al. 2002 ). Therefore an increase in NUE of plants could
reduce the application of N fertilizers and subsequently decrease the detrimentaleffect on the ecosystems in addition to the economical bene ﬁts. One of the mecha-",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,418

microbial consortia like the plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria improved plant
growth and the NUE of wheat plants and reduced the N fertilizer application by
16.7% (Varinderpal-Singh et al. 2020 ). The presented evidence indicates that AM
symbiosis could improve the NUE in plants and thereby minimizing the use ofsynthetic N fertilizers. This could have a substantial role in sustainable cropproduction.

pathways through which AM fungi in ﬂuence the N cycle includes: i) availability of

already discussed in the above sections, AM fungi affect both asymbiotic andsymbiotic N
2ﬁxation. Apart from N 2ﬁxation, other transformation rates involved
in N cycling could be mediated through substrate availability. The available sub-strate for free-living microbes occurring in N cycling may be reduced by AM fungi
either through immobilization of inorganic N to their mycelium or transport nutrients
to their host plant (Veresoglou et al. 2012 ). Also, the exudates of AM fungal hyphae

could enhance soil across the root zone directly in ﬂuencing the C limitation in some
heterotrophic microorganisms in the N cycle (Toljander et al. 2007 ).
Abiotic factors like soil moisture, pH, temperature, and aeration affect the
availability of N compounds (Avrahami and Bohannan 2007 ). Nitri ﬁcation and
denitri ﬁcation are the two important processes involved in N cycling. Both these
processes are often limited by the availability of their precursors (NH
4+and NO 3/C0),
and both have the potential to produce nitrous oxide (N 2O), a potent greenhouse gas
(Hino et al. 2010 ). However, AM fungi have been reported to affect the soil

"under elevated CO
2conditions through a sophisticated microcosm experiment. The
authors showed that under elevated CO 2, the decomposition rate of fresh above-
ground dead organic material was faster in the presence of AM fungi therebyincreasing the N content of the host plant. Nevertheless, Verbruggen et al. ( 2013 )
pointed out that microcosm experiment like these that are conducted for the short
term; therefore, such results should not be directly correlated with long-term studies.It is well known that AM fungi possess the molecular mechanisms allowing theacquisition of both inorganic and organic forms of N from the soil solution (Garciaet al. 2016 ).21 Arbuscular Mycorrhiza in Sustainable Plant Nitrogen Nutrition: Mechanisms ... 425",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,419
"Some of the studies have documented that AM fungal hyphae are extremely
efﬁcient in the uptake of N released by bacterial grazers, like the speci ﬁc soil protists
(Herdler et al. 2008 ; Koller et al. 2013 ). Around one-third of the consumed N by the
protists is released to the soil solution in the form of free NH 4+ions (Trap et al.
2016 ). Other microbial groups like AM fungi or ammonia oxidizers take up these
NH 4+ions released by the protists from the soil solution (Nannipieri and Eldor 2009 ;
Rosenberg et al. 2009 ). Therefore, AM fungi have an essential role in the recycling
of soil N by modifying the composition of the soil microbial community in therhizosphere and thereby altering the denitrifying, nitrifying, and diazotrophic sym-biotic or non-symbiotic bacteria (Veresoglou et al. 2011 ).

"21.11 Reduction of Nitrous Oxide (N 2O) Emission
Nitrous oxide (N 2O) is one of the intermediate products of denitri ﬁcation or nitri ﬁ-
cation process in the N cycle. It is an important greenhouse gas and is mostly emittedfrom agricultural soils and pastures where N fertilizers or manures rich in N are used(An et al. 2020 ). Agricultural soils are the major source of N
2O emission as only less
than half of the inorganic N applied as fertilizers to the agricultural soils are utilizedby plants and the residual N becomes the substrate for N transformation in the soil(Tonhauzer et al. 2020 ). In aerobic soils, nitri ﬁcation, mediated by microorganisms
is the prime cause of N
2O emission and the leftover N from fertilizers further
accelerates this process in agricultural ecosystems. Studies have shown that AM
symbiosis could reduce the emission of N 2O from agricultural soils. It has been
hypothesized that the outcompetition of the weak competing nitri ﬁers by the fungal",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,420
"symbiosis could reduce the emission of N 2O from agricultural soils. It has been
hypothesized that the outcompetition of the weak competing nitri ﬁers by the fungal
hyphae for NH 4+acquisition was the reason for the reduced N 2O emission in AM
fungal soils (Storer et al. 2018 ). However, the results on the competition between
microorganisms involved in N cycling and AM fungi are often inconsistent andunclear (Cavagnaro et al. 2012 ; Teutscherova et al. 2019 ). For instance,
Teutscherova et al. ( 2019 ) showed that the mycorrhization of tropical grass
Brachiaria decumbens reduced the N
2O emission after urea application by 46%
despite an increased abundance of ammonia oxidizers. This reduced N 2O emission
despite the increased populations of ammonia oxidizers bacteria was attributed to theAM fungi induced changes in the bacterial activity (Teutscherova et al. 2019 ).",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,420
"despite the increased populations of ammonia oxidizers bacteria was attributed to theAM fungi induced changes in the bacterial activity (Teutscherova et al. 2019 ).
Contrarily in a recent mesocosm experiment involving a mixture of Europeangrassland plant species, inoculation of R. irregularis to an agricultural soil
containing indigenous AM fungal community failed to reduce the potential N
2O
emission (Okiobe et al. 2020 ). Based on these results Okiobe et al. ( 2020 ) concluded
that plant diversity has a strong in ﬂuence on N 2O emission than AM fungal diversity
or abundance. In a compartmentalized mesocosm study Okiobe et al. ( 2019 ) showed
that AM fungi reduced N 2O emission through enhanced soil aggregation. Therefore
the in ﬂuence of AM fungi on N 2O emission from soils could be due to the direct or
indirect effects of AM fungi on the various processes of the N cycle.426 R. Koshila Ravi et al.",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,420
"21.12 Conclusion
The AM symbiosis contributes to plant N uptake in addition to P acquisition. The
recent advancements in direct and indirect uptake of N by AM fungi have beendocumented. The root colonization by AM fungi provides P supply to plants that inturn increase the N uptake and stimulates N
2ﬁxation in plants. The AM fungi also
interact with other soil microbes synergistically leading to improved N uptake, rootnodulation, and plant growth. The N transfer in plants is investigated through theisotope labelling method in AM symbiosis. Recent studies have carried outtranscriptome and genomic techniques for determining the actual and precise method
to study the plant N regulations mediated by AM fungi. Nevertheless, only some of",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,421
"to study the plant N regulations mediated by AM fungi. Nevertheless, only some of
the AM fungal species have been used to investigate N transfer and its regulations.Hence, further studies on the effect of other indigenous AM fungal species indifferent host plants could improve the understanding of plant N nutrition. Theapplication of AM fungi bioinoculum could decrease the reliance on chemicalfertilizers. Therefore, the AM symbiosis is of great importance for the sustainableagricultural system.

With the rapidly increasing population, the environment is getting disturbed due to
urbanization and industrialization. It is dif ﬁcult to feed the entire population of the
world which is signi ﬁcantly increasing day by day (Mahanty 2017 ; Bhargava et al.
2019a ). The natural systems have been modi ﬁed by humans due to the production of
food globally. The use of fertilizers has made it possible to meet the demands ofworld ’s food supply. But due to this practice of excessive utilization of fertilizers, the
environment has been affected to a great extent. It has led to the contamination ofground water, affected the quality of soil and biodiversity (Weber 2014 ; Kumar et al.

which have a negative impact on the yield and growth of crops. Abiotic stresseswhich include temperature of environment, salinity, smog, pH of the soil, etc., havealways affected agriculture (Wang 2015 ; Bhargava et al. 2019b ). Therefore, instead
of utilizing chemical fertilizers, an alternative method to deal with these situations isto elevate the use of biofertilizers (Weber 2014 ; Kumar et al. 2020a ). These
biofertilizers are microbial inoculants used in sustainable agriculture. The uptakeof nutrients such as phosphorous and nitrogen by plants is made more effective as a
result of their usage (Xiong 2017 ; Ajmani et al. 2019 ). The capacity to retain
nutrients by plants is also increased (Srivastava 2019 ; Bhargava et al. 2020 ).",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,432

Microorganisms like fungi, protozoa, bacteria, etc., can be used for the preparationof biofertilizers (Malusà et al. 2016 ; Bhargava et al. 2017 ). Some of these microor-
ganisms are considered to perform functions of the ecosystem for the soil and plants(Maheshwari 2012 ; Goel et al. 2017 ). Nowadays, emphasis is given towards meeting
the food requirements across the globe but with minimum impact on the environ-ment and this approach is termed as “sustainable intensi ﬁcation ”(Davis 2016 ; Gupta
et al. 2018 ).

In agricultural systems, an essential requirement in the production of crop is to
maintain the health of soil. The factors which govern the health of soil are recyclingof nutrients, transmission of disease, resistance, etc., which are associated with themicroorganisms present in the soil. The microorganisms present in the soil areaffected by the fertilizers and other inputs given to the soil (Shen 2015 ; Jain et al.
2011 ). If chemical fertilizers are used for a longer period of time, it reduces the
amount of bacteria in the soil and microbiota is also imbalanced. Hence, the
biological properties of the soil are affected. Studies have found an effective way
to regulate the microbiota of soil by mixing the chemical fertilizers withbiofertilizers. This way the good bacteria are promoted in the soil and the harmfulpathogens are snuffed out (Li 2017 ; Kaur et al. 2010 ).

"Biofertilizers contribute directly towards the increase in the concentration of
nitrogen and phosphorous in the soil. These nutrients can be directly taken up bythe plants. Studies on chickpea and sorghum have shown a rise in the nutrients of soildue to the combined effect of Rhizobium species, Glomus fasciculatum andBacillus
megaterium (Khan et al. 2010 ; Maurya et al. 2013 ). For productivity and growth of
plants, nitrogen is one of the most crucial nutrients (Mahanty 2017 ; Maurya et al.438 S. Vats et al.",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,432

The availability of nitrogen affects the biomass and the yield of crops as it is thelimiting nutrient. It regulates various processes of the plant and helps to produce
certain chemicals which ﬁght against several pathogens. A large amount of nitrogen
present in the atmosphere is unavailable to the plants until it is made to be of use.Legumes are capable of ﬁxing the nitrogen present in the atmosphere. They also set
up a symbiotic relationship with various fungi for providing proper nutrition to theplants. Planting of leguminous crops in nutrient de ﬁcient soil is an effective
approach towards development of sustainable agriculture (Mia 2010 ; Negi and
Vats 2013 ).

Depending upon the de ﬁciency in the soil and the type of plant, different types of
biofertilizers are available such as nitrogen ﬁxing, phosphorous solubilizing, phos-
phate mobilizing, plant growth promoting, and enriched compost biofertilizers.Fungal biofertilizers if either inoculated alone or in combination are bene ﬁcial to
the plants in terms of growth, crop yield, etc. With the plants, a symbiotic relation-ship is established by mycorrhiza. There are two types of mycorrhizal fungi whichplay crucial roles in the development of plants. The ﬁrst one, namely,
Ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi assist in the growth of several trees by colonizingwith the roots. They help in better absorption of nutrients such as nitrogen, phos-
phorous, etc. ECM also protect the plants from several environmental stresses,

inorganic forms, AM fungi can take up nitrogen. They can ful ﬁl up to 50% of plant ’s
requirement of nitrogen especially in the arid and semi-arid climatic conditions
(Malusà et al. 2016 ; Painuly et al. 2019 ). They are considered as one of the important
components of sustainable agriculture. They assist the plant in the following ways.(1) Enhance the rate of photosynthesis, (2) Increase the rate of nitrogen ﬁxation

both interact with identical legume. This tripartite relationship is not just responsible
for providing proper nutrition of nitrogen to the plant but also improves the yield.
Mycorrhizae are considered a prerequisite for the formation of nodules in legumes. Ithas been observed that there was improper nodulation without the formation ofmycorrhizae. With the inoculation of plants with AM fungi, that can be in the formof biofertilizers, an elevation in the rate of nitrogen ﬁxation in Leucaena

In the rhizosphere, there is large number of microorganisms present in the soil. There
is interaction between plants and microorganisms in the rhizosphere. Some of thesemicroorganisms have a functional relationship with plants. This relationship isbeneﬁcial for the plants in different ways such as enhancing their growth and

Xiong ( 2017 ) and Sharma et al. ( 2014 ) reported that the organic matter acts as a
niche for the microorganisms and also helps in recycling. The elements which areimportant in terms of nutrition are made available by these microorganisms throughdifferent biological processes. Now, biofertilizers are an important part of the systemwhich supplies nutrients and have a crucial role to play in improving the yield ofcrops (Wu 2005 ; Singh and Vats 2019 ). They are gaining popularity in different
parts of the world as they are found to protect the roots of the plant from pathogens
present in the soil along with the enhancement in the fertility of soil. The microbiota

For the improvement of biological fertility of soil, biofertilizers are considered
more superior in comparison to the chemical fertilizers used (Li 2017 ; Vats 2017 ).
Due to huge demand of food supplies, the chemical fertilizers are used frequentlywhich has polluted and damaged the habitats of useful microorganisms and insects.This has made the crops more susceptible to diseases and has also impaired the
fertility of soil. To meet the growing demand of food supplies, the productivity has to
be increased in a sustainable and environment friendly manner. Therefore, thepractice of using biofertilizers is supposed to be adopted. Biofertilizers need to bepreferred over chemical fertilizers as they are cost-effective, secrete growth hor-mones, uplift crop yield, improves nitrogen ﬁxation, and does not cause harm to the

22.2.2 Carriers for the Preparation of Biofertilizers
Biofertilizers are prepared using carrier composed of microorganisms (Wang 2015 ;
Vats and Kumar 2015 ). It is considered as a transporter of biofertilizers from the
manufacturing unit to the ﬁeld. There are different carriers for different biofertilizers
(Mahanty 2017 ; Vats and Miglani 2011 ). Generally, peat is used as a carrier for
biofertilizers in several countries. A favourable carrier should have the followingcharacteristics:440 S. Vats et al.",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,434

2. Help the microbes to grow and survive.3. Be able to absorb moisture.
4. Eco-friendly.
5. Cost-effective.6. Be able to easily discharge the useful microorganisms into the soil.
The organic waste obtained from several industries such as food and agriculture
has characteristics of a biofertilizer carrier. Making use of this organic waste is
beneﬁcial for the environment. Perlite is also an eco-friendly biofertilizer carrier
used which is composed of aluminium silicate and some amount of water. It is alsoporous and light weight. In order to store the biofertilizer carrier for a long period oftime, its sterilizations is crucial. One of the methods to sterilize the carrier material isthrough gamma irradiation. This technique is accessible and causes limited lossesduring storage. Biofertilizers on carriers are preferred over free-cell as carrier pro-vides protection to the microorganisms from environmental stress. Thereby, provid-",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,435

survival of microorganisms (Wang 2015 ; Vats and Mishra 2016 ).
22.2.3 Classi ﬁcation of Biofertilizers
In the production of crops, nowadays, biofertilizers have a crucial role to play in
terms of productivity and nutrient regulation. Biofertilizers are composed of diversemicroorganisms which when administered to plants, seeds stimulate their growth. Inthis, nitrogen ﬁxation and phosphorous solubilization are important biological
processes (Singh 2016 ; Vats and Negi 2013 ). Biofertilizers also prevent the plants
from getting infected by several diseases, e.g. Fusarium wilt disease (Li 2017 ; Vats
and Bhargava 2017a ,2017b ). Several biofertilizers are made available, listed in

Fig.22.1.
For proper growth of plants, phosphorous is an important macronutrient. Due to
reduced levels of soluble phosphate in the soil, the plant is not able to grow properly.To overcome this issue, P-fertilizers were commonly made into use. In spite of this, avery small quantity of phosphorus is used up by plants and most of it is precipitated
in the form of complexes of aluminium, iron, and calcium. The use of these",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,435
"in the form of complexes of aluminium, iron, and calcium. The use of these
fertilizers impacted the environment by causing eutrophication of water. Phospho-rous present in the soil cannot be always taken up by the plants easily. Microorgan-isms, which can solubilize phosphorous, act as biofertilizers. They convert thephosphorous which is insoluble into soluble form which is readily taken up by theplants. This approach of using phosphorous biofertilizers is responsible for improv-ing the yield of agriculture in several countries (Wang 2015 ; Vats and Kumar 2015 ).
There is a symbiotic relationship between Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and most
of the species of plants. This symbiotic relationship acts as a mediator in the
mobilization of nutrients. The fungus penetrates into the roots of the host. Firstly22 Nitrogen Fixing Fungi for Development of Biofertilizer and Future Strategies 441",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,435
"the fungus is observed to grow between the cortical cells, then escalate towards the
cell wall through hyphae and then ﬁnally into the cell. The hyphae are responsible
for increasing the surface area and mobilizing the nutrients for the soil upwards.
Therefore, mycorrhizal fungi are capable of transporting nutrients like zinc, phos-
phorous, and copper (Singh 2016 ; Vats and Negi 2013 ).
Nitrogen is one of the vital nutrients utilized by plants. To ful ﬁl the demand of
nitrogen for the growth and development of plants, nitrogen fertilizers are used
which are hazardous to the environment if utilized in excess quantities. Therefore, as
a substitute, biofertilizers are used in order to satisfy the requirements (Mia 2010 ;
Vats et al. 2019 ). Plants cannot directly take up the atmospheric nitrogen. Therefore,

absorption (Mia 2010 ; Vats et al. 2012 ). Examples of nitrogen ﬁxing biofertilizers

from root to the shoot is inhibited. The reason for this could be that AMF is able toﬁlter these heavy metal ions at the time of nutrient uptake. The accumulation of these
metals also depends upon the characteristics of soil, fungi, density of the roots, and
several other factors. AMF also plays a crucial role in the bioremediation of
radionuclides (Leyval 2002 ). Studies have shown that an association of few AMF
and PGPR increases the ef ﬁciency of phytoremediation in soil which is contami-
nated with iron. This symbiotic relationship between AMF and PGPR is not justresponsible to bring about some physiological changes but also alter the structure ofthe roots (Mishra 2016 ).Table 22.1 Function of different PGPF and their host plant

"22.2.6 Biofertilizers and Environmental Stress Management
in Plants
Plants have to deal with different kinds of environmental stresses (biotic and abiotic)
as shown in Fig. 22.2. The microorganisms which are a part of the rhizosphere
interact with plants which lead to the development of a bene ﬁcial relationship
between the two (Ahmad and Rasool 2014 ). The symbiotic relationship of plants
with fungi can be with fungal endophytes or with mycorrhizal fungi. The fungalendophytes stay in the tissues of the plants while mycorrhizal fungi stay only in theroots (Rodriguez et al. 2004 ). Ample amount of emphasis is being given to the

AMF induces the expression of certain genes which make the hostplant tolerant to drought stress. AMF develops certain biochemical and geneticmechanisms which protect the plants from pathogens. AMF alone or in combinationof other microorganisms can perform the task. For example, in tobacco plant, blankshank disease can be cured by inoculating Trichoderma harzianum and Glomus

to the combination of Pseudomonas ﬂuorescens and arbuscular mycorrhiza. The

saline stress. AMF is capable of forming various plant growth hormones along with
enhancing the uptake of nutrients. They can also make certain changes in the
biochemical properties of the host plant (Evelin et al. 2009 ). A number of biotic
factors are also responsible for creating stress in plants. The interaction betweenplants and endophytic fungi improves the health of the plant, enables it to ﬁght

22.3.1 Association of Bacteria with Fungi

a tripartite symbiosis which impacts the nitrogen uptake by the plant. Since the N446 S. Vats et al.",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,440

Association of symbionts with their hosts enables them to exist as endosymbionts
intracellularly or to reside either extracellularly (Kneip 2007 ).
Mycorrhizal symbiotic association is affected by the architecture of roots, plant
with deep roots led to an increased symbiotic rate with the fungi under low levels ofP in comparison with plant having shallow roots, although at high levels of Pnodulation was higher. These variations depict that the levels of N and P greatlyimpact the tripartite symbiotic association occurring within the plant and each micro-symbiont. In soybean plants, two micro-symbionts were co-inoculated resulting in

"increased growth of plant and formation of modules at lower levels of nitrogen and

In lichen symbioses, a mycobiont, i.e. fungal counterpart is associated with an
extracellular photobiont. The photobionts are generally discrete photosyntheticalgae, however, in lichens the cyanobacteria exist as photobionts either in associa-tion with algae as tripartite symbiosis or alone as bipartite symbiosis (Kneip 2007 ).
Photobionts supply carbon metabolites derived from photosynthesis to the fungal
partner which acts as an advantage in this association. In addition to carbon,cyanobionts supply ﬁxed N to the host. The morphological and physiological

photobionts, and thus provides ﬁxed carbon components to their partners (Honegger

"The ef ﬁcacy of the tripartite association among Rhizobium, Arbuscular mycor-

22.3.2 Mechanism
Emergence of AM fungus mycelia from the root system enables acquisition of
minerals and nutrients from the soil which are rather unreachable to roots (Smith
et al. 2004 ; Berruti et al. 2016 ). However, it is the extra-radical hyphae of AM fungi
that regulates the uptake of nutrients speci ﬁcally N and P to the plants (George et al.

easily penetrate into minute pores (Allen 2011 ). The exchange of minerals, nutrients,",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,442
"1995 ). The hyphae are very thin as compared to the roots of plants and thus they
easily penetrate into minute pores (Allen 2011 ). The exchange of minerals, nutrients,
and carbohydrates within the roots occurs at the interface of host plant and the fungalhyphae (Berruti et al. 2016 ).
The colonization of mycorrhizal fungi in turn modi ﬁes the characteristics of
plants which play a role in nutrient uptake and thus, it impacts the accumulation of
nutrients by the plants associated with mycorrhiza. The modi ﬁcations include
enhanced nutrition of phosphorus to mycorrhizal plants or might also be Phosphorusindependent. However, the most common impact post colonization of mycorrhiza ismodiﬁcation of the ratio of root and shoot (George 1994a ,1994b ) and the speci ﬁc
length of roots (George et al. 1995 ).

branched edi ﬁces within the cells, i.e., arbuscules, which are deemed to be the
operative site of exchange of nutrients (Balestrini 2015 ; Berruti et al. 2016 ). The
colonization of mycorrhiza enhanced the percentage of amino acids and organicacids within the roots and the shoots of Phleum pratense (Clapperton and Reid 1992 )
while few amino acid concentrations were increased in Plantago lanceolata (Gange
and West 1994 ; George et al. 1995 ).448 S. Vats et al.",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,442
"The physiological as well as the molecular prospects of high propinquity phos-
phate transporters in AM fungi (Harrison and van Buuren 1995 ) were extensively
examined on the basis of nutritional sense after their characterization (Harrison et al.
2002 ; Paszkowski 2002 ; Nagy 2005 ). AM fungi are capable of remarkably amelio-
rating the acquisition of mineral nutrients by plants, speci ﬁcally under low-nutrient
situations and it has been evidently depicted that plants exhibit an inorganic phos-phorus uptake symbiotic pathway (Berruti et al. 2016 ).
It has been evident that the symbiotic association of AM fungi induces PI trans-
porters expression in plants (Xie 2013 ; Walder et al. 2015 ). Apart from the enhanced
acquisition and increase in plant Pi acquisition, regulation of arbuscule morphogen-esis as well as sustenance of symbiosis has been depicted (Javot 2007 ; Yang 2012 ).

"Accompanied with the Pi transporters, which play role in uptake via arbuscles
(Harrison et al. 2002 ; Paszkowski 2002 ; Nagy 2005 ), mycorrhizal induced Ammo-
nium transporters (AMT) are also recognized (Gomez 2009 ; Kobae 2010 ). The last
step of mineral nutrient transport takes place at a membrane which is plant-derived,i.e. the periarbuscular membrane, which envelops the arbuscle. The transporterssituated at this membrane can acquire nutrients from the apoplast of periarbusculeand are transported to the cortical cells (Javot 2011 ; Bapaume and Reinhardt 2012 ).
InMedicago truncatula and soybean, the AMTs are situated in the periarbuscular
membrane, like the Pi transporters, MtPT4, initially shown in Medicago (Harrison
et al. 2002 ), thereby depicting an important role in transport of ammonium to

transport of nitrogen and other minerals is restricted from the fungi towards the plantdue to the bio-membranes that divide the tissues of the plant and the fungi (Georgeet al. 1995 ).
However, it was shown in cucumber that amino acid metabolizing enzymes were
not exactly variating among the mycorrhizal zones and the non-mycorrhizal zones
(Rosendahl 1992 ) and thus it was considered that N metabolism was not directly

Nitrogen beingan essential macronutrient and plays a crucial role in growth of plant as well as theproduct yield, so it was appropriate to consider the involvement of AM fungi inuptake of N by the plant (Miransari 2011 ).
Arbuscular fungi have the ability to utilize nitrogen released from organic as well
as inorganic sources. The AM fungi enter the plant tissues by means of vascular
bundles during mineralization and thus utilize Ni liberated by the soil microorgan-isms (Aristiz ábal et al. 2004 ; Miransari 2011 ).

Abstract Iron (Fe) is essential for the maintenance of processes such as respiration
and photosynthesis, thus being an important element for the plant production of
cultivated or natural species. However, the combination of Fe and the acidity of acid

23.1 Introduction
Soils contaminated by metals have become a global environmental problem due toanthropogenic activities, with the highest emissions occurring during the productionof steel and iron, and the combustion of fossil fuels (Sharma and Reddy 2004 ). Some
heavy metals such as iron (Fe), zinc (Zn), copper (Cu), nickel (Ni), cobalt (Co), andmanganese (Mn) are essential micronutrients for life in ecosystems, but in highconcentrations can be extremely toxic to different organisms (Ott et al. 2002 ). Thus,",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,454
"emissions of air pollutants by Fe industries can affect the surrounding vegetation at
various levels of organization, from isolated individuals to entire populations ofvarious species (Kuki et al. 2008 ; Neves et al. 2009 ).
Fe is one of the most abundant elements in the soil and one of the main pollutants
emitted by mining and ore processing activities (Neves et al. 2009 ). In higher plants,
excess Fe can cause ecophysiological damage and various nutritional disorders(Chen et al. 2015 ; Krohling et al. 2016 ), and depending on the magnitude of the
impact, the intensity and frequency exposure, as well as the susceptibility and stage
of development of plant species, it can reduce or even eliminate them from ecosys-
tems close to polluting sources (Wong et al. 1978 ; Lopes et al. 2000 ; Rocha et al.
2014 ). In these conditions, the acidity of the soil caused by acid rain makes Fe highly
available for root absorption (Hell and Stephan 2003 ; Ricachenevsky and Sperotto",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,454
"2014 ). In these conditions, the acidity of the soil caused by acid rain makes Fe highly
available for root absorption (Hell and Stephan 2003 ; Ricachenevsky and Sperotto
2014 ), which can lead to its accumulation in phytotoxic levels in plant tissues (Pugh
et al. 2002 ; Silva and Oliva 2006 ).
One of the major problems caused by high Fe concentrations in the soil is the
nutritional imbalance that can be caused in plants, inducing the de ﬁciency of some
essential minerals such as nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and magnesium (Mg),
compromising plant growth and development (Rengel 2015 ). This problem can be
aggravated if this metal precipitates around the plant roots, forming a layer of Feoxide that is commonly called “iron plate ”, that physically limits the nutrient uptake,
causing even more physiological problems for plants (Audebert and Fofana 2009 ).
In soil aerobic conditions, Fe is present in the form of oxides and hydroxides, in",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,454
"causing even more physiological problems for plants (Audebert and Fofana 2009 ).
In soil aerobic conditions, Fe is present in the form of oxides and hydroxides, in
the form of organic chelates or in the form of ferric ion (Fe
3+) which are insoluble
(Neubauer et al. 2013 ). Therefore, the concentration of Fe in the soil solution is
extremely low in most soils and, consequently, plants and microorganisms have
developed mechanisms to mobilize it and allow its uptake (Hell and Stephan 2003 ;460 S. B. de Souza et al.",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,454
"Philpott 2006 ; Kim and Lou 2007 ). Among the microorganisms with several mech-
anisms of Fe mobilization, ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi stand out, due to theircapacity of increase plant growth in the presence of toxic metals, accumulating these
contaminants in their hyphae and reducing the uptake by the plant (Ray et al. 2005 ;
Khade and Adholeya 2008 ). Thus, the introduction of these microorganisms in
contaminated soils is a promising strategy to increase the plant ’s tolerance to high
Fe availability and recover areas impacted by mining activities (Landeweert et al.2001 ; Crane et al. 2010 ; Lermen et al. 2015 ).
Ectomycorrhizae are bene ﬁcial associations between soil fungi and the roots of
forest plants. In this relationship, the plant provides the fungus with carbon, anessential element for fungal development, and the fungus increases the uptake of
water and nutrients, especially P and N (Smith and Read 2008 ). In addition to",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,455
"water and nutrients, especially P and N (Smith and Read 2008 ). In addition to
improving soil structure, mycorrhizae may offer resistance to soil pathogens(Chakravarty and Unestam 1987 ), to abiotic stresses such as drought (Osonubi
et al. 1991 ), or to the accumulation of toxic elements such as metals (Colpaert and
Van Assche 1993 ). The effectiveness of a diversity of associations between fungi
and plants, in relation to their growth on substrates containing metals, has been testedand proven for several metals, which has been related to a series of extra andintracellular fungal mechanisms (Gadd 1993 ).
The plant-mycorrhizal fungus relationship is speci ﬁc and can be in ﬂuenced by
several factors such as competition with other microorganisms, availability ofnutrients, pH, humidity, and temperature (Augé 2001 ; Alves et al. 2001 ; Tagu
et al. 2002 ). Therefore, these factors must be studied in order to obtain a more",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,455
"et al. 2002 ). Therefore, these factors must be studied in order to obtain a more
efﬁcient plant-fungus relationship. In addition, the mechanisms involved in confer-
ring increased tolerance to heavy metals have proved dif ﬁcult to resolve, as different
species or isolates of the same fungal species may present several responses tovarious types of contaminants (Krpata et al. 2008 ; Bojarczuk and Kieliszewska-
rokicka 2010 ; Reis et al. 2012 ). For this reason, the use of different sources of a
contaminant can elucidate the mechanisms used by ECM fungi to absorb nutrientsand avoid toxicity of metals.
23.2 Iron in the Soil and in Plants
Fe is the second most abundant transition metal in the lithosphere and the fourthmost abundant element in the Earth ’s crust after oxygen, silicon, and aluminium
(Pantopoulos and Hentze 2000 ; Johnson et al. 2012 ).
In the environment, Fe can exist in several oxidation states, but the main forms
that occur naturally in the soil are ferrous (Fe",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,455
"(Pantopoulos and Hentze 2000 ; Johnson et al. 2012 ).
In the environment, Fe can exist in several oxidation states, but the main forms
that occur naturally in the soil are ferrous (Fe
2+) and ferric (Fe3+), which are highly
dependent on the redox state of the system (Ilbert and Bonnefoy 2013 ). The ferric
form is generally the most abundant, but it has low solubility, so is less available forabsorption. The bioavailability of Fe sources is mainly in ﬂuenced by the pH,
whereas soluble forms predominate in acidic pHs, and insoluble forms predominatein basic pHs (Kim and Lou 2007 ; Ricachenevsky and Sperotto 2014 ). The23 Iron Toxicity and Its Relation to Nitrogen and Phosphorus Availability in ... 461",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,455
"bioavailability of Fe is also limited due to the formation of oxides and hydroxides,
which are insoluble in aerobic conditions (Arantes and Milagres 2007 ; Marschner
et al. 2011 ).
Despite the low availability in most soils, in some environments, such as wetlands
and soils with high in ﬂuence from mining plants, soluble Fe can be highly available,
becoming toxic. Excess free Fe is harmful to living cells as it generates cytotoxichydroxyl radicals, and only small amounts of essential metals are tolerated within thecell as free ions. This can be applied to all metals, but especially for redox-ions ofactive metals such as Cu and Fe, which are capable of causing the formation ofhydroxyl radicals and other types of oxidative damage (Jeong and Guerinot 2009 ;
Ravet et al. 2009 ).

"Ravet et al. 2009 ).
This metal has a high biological demand and is essential for both eukaryotic and
prokaryotic beings (Johnson 2008 ; Kobayashi and Nishizawa 2012 ), since it is
directly involved in fundamental processes such as photosynthesis, respiration,nitrogen ﬁxation, DNA, and hormone synthesis (Gurzau et al. 2003 ; Vigani 2012 ).
Fe homeostasis is extremely important and is in ﬂuenced by plant species or geno-
type, the location (type of soil), time of year, age of the plant and the organ or tissueof the plant (Buchanan et al. 2000 ). Therefore, the balance of Fe must be strictly
controlled, as both de ﬁciency and toxicity affect the development (Kuki et al. 2008 ;
Briat et al. 2010 ) and several physiological process of plants (Pereira et al. 2013 ).

"Plants have speci ﬁc mechanisms for Fe uptake in order to supply its demand for
growth and development. Under normal conditions, with a suf ﬁcient concentration
of Fe in the soil, plants reduce Fe
3+to Fe2+through the plasma membrane via a low
afﬁnity transporter (Curie and Briat 2003 ). Under aerobic conditions, the concen-
tration of Fe2+in the soil solution is usually low, thus, in conditions of Fe de ﬁciency,
plants have developed different strategies to increase the uptake of this nutrient.According to Römheld ( 1987 ) and Marschner and Rohmëld ( 1994 ) these strategies
were called Strategy I (reduction of Fe

However, in acidic soils, where the low pH increases the availability of Fe2+
(Lemanceau et al. 2009 ; Fodor et al. 2012 ), this metal ceases to be an essential
nutrient to become a toxic element, being potentially harmful to the cell due to theformation of free radicals generated by the Fenton reaction (Ravet et al. 2009 ;
Kobayashi and Nishizawa 2012 ; Pereira et al. 2013 ). The excess of Fe can also
cause nutritional imbalances in plants, inducing de ﬁciency of some essential min-
erals such as P, calcium (Ca), potassium (K), Mg, and Zn, it can damage the
photosynthetic apparatus, reduce the chlorophyll content, cause oxidative stressdue to the production of reactive oxygen species, chlorosis in old leaves, browningof the roots and inhibition of plant growth (Connolly and Guerinot 2002 ; Suh et al.
2002 ; Chatterjee et al. 2006 ; Sahrawat 2005 ; Audebert and Fofana 2009 ).

"2002 ; Chatterjee et al. 2006 ; Sahrawat 2005 ; Audebert and Fofana 2009 ).
The concentrations of Fe in the plant vary between 10 and 1500 mg kg
/C01of dry
matter, depending on the part of the plant and the species, considering concentrationsbetween 50 and 100 mg kg
/C01as adequate for normal plant growth (Dechen and
Nachtigall 2006 ). However, to achieve toxic levels, the concentrations can depend
on the species, cultivar, physiological state and growth conditions (Mahender et al.462 S. B. de Souza et al.",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,456
"2019 ). In plants of Solanum tuberosum L., values between 61 and 134 mg of Fe kg/C01
of dry matter are considered toxic (Chatterjee et al. 2006 ), but in Eugenia uni ﬂoraL.,
the toxicity symptoms were only detected in the concentrations from 120 to 229 mg
of Fe kg/C01of dry matter (Jucoski et al. 2016 ).
In order to survive in conditions of Fe toxicity, plants developed morphological
and physiological mechanisms to prevent or even tolerate such conditions, whichare: strategy I, a mechanism for the exclusion of Fe

and formation of the ferric plaque in the rhizosphere; strategy II, mechanisms ofinclusion, sequestration in vacuoles, apoplast, and ferritin proteins; strategy III,mechanism of tolerance or inactivation of Fe in plant tissues, detoxi ﬁcation by

Contaminated soils can be remedied by physical (soil removal and treatment) or
biological techniques (Khan et al. 2000 ; Ali et al. 2013 ). Both are widely used,
however, the biological technique preserves useful microorganisms such as solubi-lizing bacteria and mycorrhizal fungi, as well as the existing fauna, maintaining theecological balance and soil functionality (Altieri 1999 ; Finlay 2008 ; Kuki et al.
2008 ). The use of microorganisms associated with vascular plants can be a promis-
ing alternative in the recovery of environments contaminated by this pollutant

"(Landeweert et al. 2001 ; Crane et al. 2010 ; Lermen et al. 2015 ).
In this context, one of the factors that allow tolerant plants to survive in contam-
inated areas is the colonization of their roots by mycorrhizal fungi. During thissymbiosis, the host plant has increased growth, productivity, greater capacity toabsorb water and nutrients from the soil and reduced damage caused by pathogens,and in exchange the fungus receive carbon originated from the photosyntheticprocess (St-Arnaud and Vujanovic 2007 ; Smith and Read 2008 ; Ismail and Hijri
2012 ). About 80% of plants exposed to conditions of environmental stress are
colonized by mycorrhizal fungi (Smith and Read 2008 ), because the fungus-plant
association considerably reduces the uptake of heavy metals by plant cells(Weissenhorn et al. 1995 ; Leyval et al. 1997 ; Ouziad et al. 2005 ; Hildebrandt
et al. 2007 ).

"et al. 2007 ).
There are several types of mycorrhizae and among them, ECM fungi have stood
out due to their ability to alleviate metal toxicity for a host plant, being crucial for thesustainability of terrestrial ecosystems, not only because of their presence, but
because of their genetic and functional diversity (Domínguez-Núñez and Albanesi
2019 ). The mechanisms involved in increasing this tolerance are diverse and have a
high speci ﬁcity between different types of metals, their concentration in the soil, the
associated fungi and the growth of plants (Hartley et al. 1997 ; Hildebrandt et al.23 Iron Toxicity and Its Relation to Nitrogen and Phosphorus Availability in ... 463",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,457
"2007 ). It is possible that the protection of ECM fungi against heavy metals is due to
the extracellular fungal mycelium acting as a physical protective barrier preventing
the metal uptake by the host plant (Khan et al. 2000 ). There are also biological
mechanisms, which include extracellular precipitation processes, cell wallbiosorption through ion exchange, adsorption, complexation and crystallization,and internal processes in fungal cells, where metals can be complexed, compart-mentalized or volatilized (Gadd 1993 ; Colpaert et al. 2011 ). All of these mechanisms
are summarized in Fig. 23.1.
Due to the redox properties of Fe, microorganisms have developed mechanisms
for the maintenance and preservation of Fe homeostasis to prevent both a de ﬁciency
(Quatrini et al. 2005 ; Legay et al. 2012 ) and possible oxidative stress (Touati 2000 ;

The formation of chelates (siderophore or organic acid) is an important process
both for Fe resistance and for its uptake by ECM fungi (Illmer and Buttinger 2006 ;
Johnson 2008 ; Haselwandter 2008 ; Kobayashi and Nishizawa 2012 ; Pereira et al.
2013 ). The use of chelating agents like siderophores, bene ﬁts the Fe uptake when
this element is scarce in the environment and would also act under stress conditions,forming a Fe
3+-siderophore complex, thus facilitating the storage of intracellular Fe
(Arantes and Milagres 2007 ; Aliasgharzad et al. 2009 ; Harrington et al. 2011 ).
Similarly, organic acids, amino acids, metallothioneins, and glycoproteins are also
secreted into the soil by ECM fungi, as chelating agents, and bind to Fe, reducing itsmobility and bioavailability for assimilation by plants (Shi et al. 2018 ).

mediate products in their synthesis pathway or by increasing the activity of keyenzymes, such as tyrosinases and laccases, which act on their biosynthesis (McGraw
2003 ).

the uptake of this macronutrient (Giesler et al. 2004 ). The high af ﬁnity of Fe oxides

"An interesting parameter to analyse when studying the relationship between Fe
and P is the extracellular pH, since it been demonstrated that in high pH soils, P ionsareﬁxed as Ca phosphates, while at low pH, Fe and Al phosphates are prevalent,
thus reducing P mobility (Jayachandran et al. 1989 ). We observed that the
P. tinctorius extracellular pH was signi ﬁcantly lower than the pH of P. albus in all
FeSPM concentrations (Fig. 23.6), which would explain the higher content of Fe
and, consequently, smaller content of P found in the mycelium of the ﬁrst fungus.
Such medium acidi ﬁcation has been previously demonstrated in an isolate of
P. tinctorius (Pt715) and was attributed to a high H
+efﬂux (Zhang et al. 2014 ).
Also, the higher melanin production of P. tinctorius compared to P. albus , could be
responsible for the chelation of the inorganic Fe-P complex in the fungal cell wall,thus resulting in increasing Fe content without increased P content.AB

"ECM fungal species could vary in their abilities to adapt to the most variated soils
conditions, like poor nutrient, drought, and heavy metal toxicity. It is possible toobserve, from the results demonstrated in Fig. 23.5, that P. tinctorius and P. albus
have a great variation in Fe and P uptake in medium containing high concentration of
FePSM, whereas P. albus is more ef ﬁcient in P uptake than P. tinctorius . This could
be due to a chelation of Fe through the exudation of several organic acids such ascitric, malic, oxalic, malonic, and lactic acid, thereby solubilizing phosphates andincreasing the P release (Feng et al. 2011 ; Zhang et al. 2014 ; Adeleke et al. 2010 ), or
the synthesis of siderophores, like hydroxamates, that form strong and stable com-plexes with Fe

"3+, thus chelating Fe and releasing P from iron phosphate complexes
(Haselwandter et al. 2011 ,2013 ).
Among environmental restrictions, the availability of nutrients, mainly P and N,
are the most studied since they can limit plant production (Rotaru and Sinclair 2009 ;
Vitousek et al. 2010 ). In this context, ectomycorrhizae play an important role,
because this interaction increases the area of soil explored by the roots and modi ﬁes
the root architecture, thus enhancing the uptake water and nutrients (Smith and Read2008 ; Falandysz and Borovi čka2013 ; Clasen et al. 2018 ). In forest species most of
the N is found in the organic form coupled with organic matter or soil litter, and witha slow rate of mineralization. ECM fungi have an ability to decompose these organic
complexes, absorbing it in the form of ammonium (NH
4+), thus contributing in a
quantitative and qualitative way to the N nutrition of plants (Lindahl et al. 2007 ;",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,464

quantitative and qualitative way to the N nutrition of plants (Lindahl et al. 2007 ;
Lindahl and Tunlid 2015 ; Shah et al. 2016 ; Makarov 2019 ).
N can also be absorbed by fungi from proteins complexed in the soil ’s organic
matter. When the fungus switch from NH4+to protein as the main N source, the
production ofOH is induced, as well as the release of proteolytic enzymes. From the
release ofOH, proteins complexed in organic matter are oxidized, and the extracel-
lular proteolytic activity is enhanced (Fig. 23.7). This happens because, oxidized
protein substrates allow greater proteolytic activity when compared to unmodi ﬁed
proteins. This entire process is directly regulated by NH4+concentrations, whose
depletion activates the signalling for protein-N nutrition and is only possible due to

in an optimal concentration is important for the N nutrition of ECM fungi andconsequently for plants (Op De Beeck et al. 2018 ).
The N biogeochemical cycle is interfered by anthropogenic activities (Elser et al.
2007 ), which can increase N concentrations and interfere with P de ﬁciency (Liu et al.
2013 ; Du and Fang 2014 ; Tarvainen et al. 2016 ). Environments with a high
concentration of Fe directly affect the availability of P, however, it does not interferewith N bioavailability regardless of the Fe source (Table 23.1).
Nevertheless, the uptake of N could be altered by Fe concentrations in ECM
fungi. For instance, both P. tinctorius andP. albus showed an increased N

"In the plant-fungus association, the bioavailability of N can be affected by the
rhizosphere pH (Rotaru and Sinclair 2009 ). In acidic soils, plants absorb N in the
form of nitrate (NO 3/C0) and exchange it for anions (OH/C0), increasing the pH and the
availability of some nutrients in the rhizosphere. If the pH increases above 5.5, it can
cause a reduction in the availability of metallic nutrients such as Fe (which mayprevent possible toxicity). However, the uptake of N in the form of NH
4+by the
plant, results in the acidi ﬁcation of the rhizosphere, increasing the availability of P
and Fe (Ariz et al. 2018 ).
The growth resulting from the symbiotic N 2ﬁxation has a higher P requirement
than the growth supported by NO 3/C0assimilation, via reduction in atmospheric N 2by
the nitrogenase system (Liu et al. 2013 ). A higher concentration of N in the plant

"the nitrogenase system (Liu et al. 2013 ). A higher concentration of N in the plant
would require more P available to avoid de ﬁciencies that would limit the growth of
the plant (Huang et al. 2012 ). The biological ﬁxation of N 2in legumes also leads to
H+extrusion, which can increase the availability of nutrients necessary for this
process, such as P and Fe (Raven et al. 1990 ). Liu et al. ( 2012 ) analysed the effect
of N and P addition to the soil on microbial biomass and showed that the addition ofN decreased the microbial biomass of the soil in the short term, due to acidi ﬁcation
of the soil resulting from the uptake of NH
4+by plants and the nitri ﬁcation of NH4+
in the soil. However, the addition of P in the soil increased microbial biomass,
indicating that the availability of P is a limiting factor for microbial growth.

"23.5 Conclusion and Future Prospects
The availability of nutrients, mainly P and N, as well as heavy metals, such as Fe, can
limit plant production, however, the low soil fertility contributes to an effectivemycorrhization, thus favouring plant growth. In soils contaminated by Fe, theassociation of forest species with ECM fungi allows the development of the plant,because these fungi have mechanisms to avoid the uptake of excess metal by theplant. The ability of ECM fungi to withstand the stress induced by toxic concentra-
tions of Fe in their environment is related to their ability to immobilize, sequester,
and compartmentalize this metal. These tolerance mechanisms include adsorption bythe cell wall or cell wall compounds such as melanin, precipitation in the extracel-lular matrix, chelation by compounds such as organic acids and siderophores, andintracellular processes of chelation by metallothioneins or sequestration byphytochelatins inside the vacuoles.",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,466
"Fe is an essential element for plant and fungi growth and development, existing in
several forms (FeSO
4, FeCl 3, Fe-EDTA, Fe-citrate, FePSM), with an availability
strongly dependent on the environmental pH and directly in ﬂuencing the uptake of
important nutrients like P and N. However, there are few studies regarding theinteraction of Fe with the main macro and micronutrients and its effect on the growthof ECM fungi. Fungi of the genus Pisolithus stand out for their tolerance to high
concentrations of Fe and for presenting differences in tolerance between species,472 S. B. de Souza et al.",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,466
"becoming a promising model in studies of the interaction of Fe with the fungal and
plant ionome and its relationship with tolerance to this heavy metal.
ECM fungi are capable of mobilize and store Fe in toxic concentrations, however,
this ability can vary according to the species of fungus, the host plant, the concen-
tration and source of the metal. High concentrations of Fe can in ﬂuence the uptake of
nutrients essential to the ectomycorrhizae physiology. When in excess, Fe binds to Pmaking it unavailable for uptake by plants and microorganisms, however, the samedoes not happen with N, because it depends on the form that this nutrient will beabsorbed, in which excess Fe contributes to the uptake of NH
4while decreasing
uptake of NO 3/C0. Despite not in ﬂuencing the availability of N in high concentrations,
Fe in optimal concentrations can be very important for N nutrition of plants and
fungi, participating in the demineralization process of N trapped in the soil ’s organic
matter.",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,467

In this context, the use of software that allow the predictions of nutrients

Role of Algae in Soil Nitrogen Fixation
Anamika Singh
Abstract Microorganisms help to increase the soil nutritional quality, as they are
able to decompose organic matter. From soil, plants get nutrition for their growth and
development. Along with microorganism, many fungi and algae also perform such
functions. Algal cells are natural fertilizer and nowadays it is used worldwide,
without any side effect, Algal cells have speci ﬁc cells called heterocyst and are the
site of nitrogen ﬁxation. Algae are able to convert unavailable dinitrogen into
bioavailable ammonia. Anabaena ,Nostoc , and many other cyanobacteria (blue
green algae, BGA) are able to ﬁx atmospheric nitrogen.

24.1 Introduction
Nitrogen is the most abundant gas in the earth ’s atmosphere, it is nearly 79%. In
atmosphere it is present in the form of di-nitrogen (N 2). It is one of the most
important elements for survival of life on Earth. Proteins, nucleic acids and chloro-
phyll (Ferguson 1998 ; Smil 2004 ) are the few most important Nitrogen containing
biological molecules. These biological molecules are required for need to build,
cytochromes, alkaloids, phytohormones, and many of the vitamins (Bray 1983 ). The
dinitrogen form of nitrogen is highly inaccessible to most organisms, because both
the nitrogen atoms (N ¼N) linked to each other by a triple bonds, that make the
molecule almost inert (Jia and Quadrelli 2014 ; MacKay 2004 ). About 225 kcal of
energy is required to break this triple bond, and it is dif ﬁcult to achieve. Primary

"ecological impact of the world depends upon the agriculture production and it is
directly linked to availability of ﬁxed nitrogen. Ammonia (NH 3) or nitrate (NO 3–)
(Canﬁeld et al. 2010 ; Cheng 2008 ) are the two important ﬁxed forms of nitrogen,
utilized by organisms and are continuously sequestered into sediments, rendering
them unavailable for metabolism. Nitri ﬁcation and denitri ﬁcation are the two com-
bined processes related to nitrogen metabolism and is the conversion of N 2to NH 3
(Cheng 2008 ; Thamdrup 2012 ). The process of conversion of molecular and ele-
mental free nitrogen into nitrogenous compounds, which can be easily absorbed bythe plants, is called as nitrogen ﬁxation. It is carried out by physicochemical and
biological means. About 10% of natural nitrogen ﬁxation takes place by physico-
chemical methods and 90% by biological methods. In nature nitrogen ﬁxation is a

Galloway 2008 ) and (2) biological nitrogen ﬁxation (Burk et al. 1934 ; McGlynn et
al.2013 ; Dos Santos et al. 2012 ).
Non-biological nitrogen ﬁxation mainly includes natural nitrogen ﬁxation and
industrial nitrogen ﬁxation (Fig. 24.1). Industrial is through the Haber –Bosch
process (Smil 2004 ; Haber 1992 ,1923 ). Haber –Bosch process is widely used for
the production of nitrogen fertilizers and almost half of the human population

"depends upon its applications (Smil 2004 ; Can ﬁeld et al. 2010 ). In nitrogen cycle
few microorganisms like bacteria play important role in the conversion of N 2to
ammonia, other bacteria convert ammonia to nitrate and few nitrates to nitrogen gas.

It contains natural as well as industrial nitrogen ﬁxation.
24.2.1 Natural Nitrogen Fixation
Under the in ﬂuence of lightning (i.e., electric discharge in the clouds) and thunder,
N2and O 2of the air react to form nitric oxide (NO). The nitric oxides are again
oxidized with oxygen to form nitrogen peroxide (NO 2).
The reactions are as follows

During rains, NO 2combines with rain water to form nitrous acid (HNO 2) and
nitric acid (HNO 3). The acids fall on the soil along with rain water and react with the

"24.3 Biological Nitrogen Fixation
Biological nitrogen ﬁxation is a process mediated by living organism, and they are
actually ﬁxing the nitrogen into the nitrogenous. It is carried out by two main types
of microorganisms: (1) symbiotic microorganisms and (2) non-symbiotic microor-ganisms. Symbiotic association involves interaction of plants and microorganisms.Biological nitrogen ﬁxation (BNF) involves reduction of atmospheric nitrogen into
ammonia.
Diazotrophy
Biological nitrogen ﬁxation through the agency of microorganism occurs in
the presence of nitrogenize enzyme. Thiss enzyme is actually a biological
catalyst present in few symbiotic microorganisms like Rhizobium andFrankia
or the free-living Azospirillum andAzotobacter and blue green algae (BGA).
These microorganisms are able to reduce inert gaseous dinitrogen (N

It is a complex biochemical reactions and can be summarized as:
N2þ8H2þ16ATP nitrogenase !2N H 3þ2H2þ16ADP þ16 P i
In this equation one molecule of nitrogen gas (N 2) combines with eight
hydrogen ions (also known as protons) (8H+) to form two molecules of
ammonia (2NH 3) and two molecules of hydrogen gas (2H 2). This reaction
occurs in the presence of nitrogenase enzyme. The 16 molecules of ATP (ATP¼adenosine triphosphate, an energy storing compound) represent the energy
required for the biological nitrogen ﬁxation (BNF) reaction to take place.

Nitrogen Fixers
These are mainly bacteria and cyanobacteria (blue green algae, BGA), called as
diazotrophs. They are able to ﬁx almost 95% of the total global nitrogen.
Diazotrophs may be symbiotic (free living) or symbiotic.

24.4 Cyanophycean Algae and Nitrogen Fixation
Algae is playing an important role in nitrogen ﬁxation especially cyanobacteria (blue
green algae, BGA). Cyanobacteria or blue green algae are a diverse group of pro-karyotes that mostly form a complex association with bacteria and green algae, andthis structure is known as cyanobacterial mats (Rodrigo and Novelo 2007 ).
Cyanophyceae or myxophyceae are algal group having xanthophyll, carotenes,
and chlorophyll A and are photosynthetic in nature. They also have phycocyanine,phycoerythrin, and phycobilin pigments. They are known as Cyanophyta(Cyanophyceae, Myxophyta), now popularly called as Cyanobacteria (Accordingto the “Bergey ’s Manual of Systematic Bacteriology ”Vol. 3 1989). There are",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,479
"different types of blue green algae that help differently in soil nitrogen ﬁxation.
Cyanobacteria are classi ﬁed in Bergey ’s Manual and has ﬁve orders (subsections).
These ﬁve orders (subsections) include three for non-heterocystous types algae and
two for heterocystous type algae (Castenholz 2001 ; Castenholz and Waterbury24 Role of Algae in Soil Nitrogen Fixation 487",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,479
"1989 ). The non-heterocystous algae belongs to order Chroococcales ,
Pleurocapsales , and Oscillatoriales , while heterocystous algae belongs to order
Nostocales and Stigonematales and they all are able to ﬁx atmospheric (Bergman
et al. 1997 ).
From Table 24.1 it is clear that cyanophycean algae may have heterocyst or may
not have but in both the cases they are able to ﬁx atmospheric nitrogen. Totally, more
than 150 species of 33 genera have been reported to be able to ﬁx nitrogen (Li et al.
1983 ). There are many unicellular blue green algae, able to ﬁx nitrogen like
Gloeocapsa, almost ﬁve different strains have been reported that can ﬁx nitrogen

growth at the expense of N 2under aerobic conditions in both unicellular and
multicellular forms. Non-heterocystous algae are having ability to synthesize nitro-genase. Plectonema boryanum (Stewart et al. 1969 ; Lex 1970 ) can ﬁx atmospheric
nitrogen only under microaerobic conditions. Similarly, Phormidium, Raphidiopsis(Singh 1961 ), Oscillatoria, Lyngbya, and Plectonema were shown to ﬁxN

nitrogen ﬁxation in algae cells. Further it was reported that nitrogenase is located in
the heterocyst under aerobic growth conditions (Stewart et al. 1969 ; Fleming and

Heterocysts (Gr. Hetero ¼different; Cyst ¼swollen and encapsulated cell) are
found in many species of ﬁlamentous blue-green algae (Fay and Fogg 1962 ).
Heterocysts are anaerobic factories for nitrogen ﬁxation. These cells are slightly
larger size as compared to vegetative cells, and it also develops from vegetative cells
and may be solitary, or in pairs, or several in a row (Fogg 1949 ). It is a colourless,
enlarged, thick walled cell without chlorophyll (Fig. 24.3). It is the site for nitrogen
ﬁxation, and it has nitrogenase enzyme (Stewart et al. 1980 ). The cell is maintained
in its anoxic condition as it lacks photosynthetic activity (produce oxygen) and thickTable 24.2 Different Cyanophycean algae and its groups

erocyst contains only photosystem1 for ATP production, Photosystem II iscompletely absent. Heterocysts cells are linked with other cells through plasmodes-mata and get nutrients from surrounding cells. The shape of the heterocysts and itsposition in the trichomes are determined genetically. The number of heterocysts in
trichomes of any algal populations depends on the nitrogen supply in the environ-ment. As the level of NH
4+or NO 3/C0increases, the number of heterocyst decreases
within a trichome.
At low intensity of light and at high concentration of phosphate in medium, the
number of heterocyst in ﬁlament increases in algae (Fay and Fogg 1962 ). Hetero-

i.e., roughly at regular distances from one another, or in pairs ( Anabaenopsis ).
During development, the thylakoid apparatus degrades and speci ﬁc DNA

Nif Gene
The atmospheric nitrogen ﬁxation is an energy intensive process. If there is no
nitrogen ﬁxation by cell all the enzymes must be tightly controlled and not to

few regulatory proteins involved in nitrogen ﬁxation. Primarily nif genes
encode nitrogenase complex, which can convert atmospheric nitrogen toammonia like nitrogen forms.

negative regulators and a set of seven operons which includes 17 nif genes. Nifgenes have both positive and negative regulators. Some nif genes are: Nif A,D,L,K, F,H,S,U,Y,W,Z.
Nitrogen sensitive NifA protein activates nif genes transcription. NtrC,
which is an RNA polymerase is used by plants when there is not enoughﬁxed amount of nitrogen factor, and it triggers NifA ’s expression. Further
NifA activates the transcription for the nif genes. NifL protein gets activatedwhenever there is suf ﬁcient amount of reduced nitrogen or oxygen present in
the cell. In such situation NifL inhibits activity of NifA activity that causesinhibition of nitrogenase formation in cell. Then NifL is regulated by otherproteins, and this protein is sensitive for O

Nitrogenase Nitrogenase term was given by Burk 1934 for the enzyme that catal-
yses the conversion of atmospheric unavailable nitrogen to a bio-accessible nitrogen(Burk et al. 1934 ). Nitrogenase is playing very vital and meaningful role in hetero-
cyst. Nitrogenase is two soluble protein components: (1) Component I or Mo-Fe
protein also known as dinitrogenase consists of 2 Mo atoms, 28 –34 Fe atoms, and
26–28 acid-labile sulphides, also known as iron-molybdenum cofactor (FeMoco).
Component I has two copies each of two subunits αandβ(Fig. 24.4). (2) Component

Abstract An innumerable group of microorganisms are associated with plants and
present in the phyllosphere, rhizosphere, and endosphere. They produce different
metabolites —such as amino acids, proteins, polysaccharides, and vitamins —that
affect plant growth and help to improve soil fertility and crop production naturally.
Furthermore, among all inhabitants of the rhizosphere, cyanobacteria are among the
foremost organisms, with potential to contribute to biological nitrogen ﬁxation. They
contain a specialized type of cell (a heterocyst), which is considered the actual site of

"25.1 Introduction
The plant rhizosphere is enriched with very high abundance and varying population
fractions of the microbiota. One such microbial fraction comprises different
cyanobacteria sustained in associative or free-living symbiosis with a variety of
plant roots. Cyanobacteria, which are popularly known as diazotrophic blue-greenalgae, are considered to be one of the oldest and most pioneering forms of photo-synthetic microbes in the evolutionary history of life (Demoulin et al. 2019 ). In fact,
they are often described as early colonizers and initiators of primary ecologicalsuccession on bare land, in association with fungi (lichens) (Lan et al. 2012 ).
Members of cyanobacterial communities are chlorophyll-containing, simple thal-loid, autotrophic, aerobic, Gram-negative, unicellular or multicellular, ﬁlamentous
or non ﬁlamentous prokaryotic cells, ranging between 0.5 –1 and 40 μm in diameter,",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,490
"or non ﬁlamentous prokaryotic cells, ranging between 0.5 –1 and 40 μm in diameter,
and they build ecological niches in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems (Whitton andPotts 2012 ). In terrestrial soil ecosystems, some free-living forms ( Anabaena ,
Calothrix ,Oscillatoria ,Tolypothrix , and Scytonema , among others) can be found
inhabiting and colonizing the rhizospheric soil of various members of the plantkingdom, ranging from bryophytes to angiosperms (Adams et al. 2013 ). Some
members, such as those belonging to the genus Nostoc , have been found to establish
endosymbiotic relationships with coralloid roots of pteridophytes (Chang et al.
2019 ). The sole role of these microalgal communities in the rhizosphere is to convert
atmospheric nitrogen into ammonia, thus making nitrogen bioavailable to plants andhence enhancing plant growth. In nutrient-rich aquatic ecosystems, they form densegreen free- ﬂoating colonial clusters by aggregation of millions of cyanobacteria,",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,490
"resulting in algal blooms and thus causing eutrophication.
Colonies of different members dwelling in the rhizosphere or in any other habitat
show various types of morphological, physiological, and biochemical adaptations tocope with the selective pressures operating within their ecological niche (Galhano
et al. 2011 ). Some of them can produce ﬁlaments, sheets, or even hollow spheres
(Sand-Jensen 2014 ). To protect their thalloid body from desiccation and mechanical
stress, they secrete mucilage. Their potential to differentiate into multiple cellsperforming specialized functions within the same ﬁlament is important in terms of
the physiological and biochemical aspects of cyanobacteria with respect to survival.Under favorable conditions, the primary thalloid body is composed of vegetativecells and photosynthetic cells. However, in adverse conditions, some cells in theﬁlament differentiate to form climate-resistant spores called akinetes (Sukenik et al.",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,490
"2015 ). Moreover, the majority of cyanobacterial species develop several thick-
walled cells, called heterocysts, after every 9 –15 cells at repeated intervals within
theﬁlament (Kumar et al. 2010 ). These special cells harbor the oxygen-sensitive
nitrogenase (the enzymatic complex that enables nitrogen ﬁxation) and serve as the
principal anaerobic site most suitable for nitrogen ﬁxation. It is important to note that
free-living cyanobacteria such as Nostoc can supply large amounts of nitrogen to
plant roots after they die, followed by lysis of the ﬁlament along with the ammonia-
rich heterocyst cells (Meeks and Elhai 2002 ). However, endosymbiont498 A. Mishra et al.",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,490
"cyanobacteria can survive in dark conditions in plant tissues and supply plants with
nitrogen in the form of ammonia in their living state (Issa et al. 2014a ,2014b ).
Their metabolic ﬂexibility means that cyanobacteria principally obtain nutrients
by performing photosynthesis, which makes them self-suf ﬁcient for their own food
production and one of the major sources of oxygen evolution (Hamilton et al. 2016 ).
In fact, it is believed that their photosynthetic metabolism, contributing to oxygenproduction, set the foundation for emergence of aerobic life-forms on Earth millionsof years ago (Schirrmeister et al. 2011 ). Also, the biochemical diversity and meta-
bolic potential of various members of this group has enabled them to interconnectwith an extensive network of ecosystem services in synergism with other bioticcomponents of nature (Kumar et al. 2015 ). Some of the important ecosystem
services they provide include their abilities to carry out nitrogen and carbon ﬁxation,",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,491
"services they provide include their abilities to carry out nitrogen and carbon ﬁxation,
produce oxygen, promote plant growth, shape plant rhizosphere microbiomes, andperform nutrient cycling by linking several biogeochemical cycles. The potent plantgrowth –promoting properties of cyanobacterial inoculants can be commercially
exploited as biofertilizers with promising results (Chittora et al. 2020 ). Ongoing
research and genome decoding of several species of cyanobacteria have ﬁrmly
proved their multidimensional bene ﬁts in plant productivity and crop improvement.
25.2 Diversity and Ecological Distribution
of Cyanobacteria in the Plant Rhizosphere
Cyanobacteria (blue-green algae) are photosynthetic prokaryotic free-living bacteria
from an ancient lineage, and they are established in most, though not all, types ofenvironment. They are globally responsible for much of the primary production andnitrogen ﬁxation that occurs globally. Global ecosystems have been immeasurably",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,491
"impacted by cyanobacteria, and their photosynthetic actions support oxygen require-ments for procreation of aerobic life-forms. Additionally, cyanobacteria areacknowledged as the abundant primary manufacturer on Earth. Furthermore,cyanobacteria can be found in marine habitats, hot habitats, cold habitats, freshwater
habitats, and terrestrial habitats. Cyanobacteria also commonly enter into symbiotic
relationships with plants, eukaryotic algae, and fungi. A considerable contribution ofcyanobacteria is the plant chloroplast, in which a cyanobacterium lives inside theplant ’s cells and survives by taking in food that the plant makes for itself. In the early
Cambrian period or in the late Proterozoic period, cyanobacteria took up residence insome eukaryote cells, conducting an endosymbiotic relationship by providing foodfor them in return for shelter (Issa et al. Issa et al. 2014a ,2014b ). Cyanobacteria

"require only light, oxygen, inorganic substances, carbon dioxide, and water to
manufacture their food. Photosynthesis is still considered to be their prime food-
manufacturing process, but some cyanobacteria can survive in complete darkness.Cyanobacteria are considered to be the ﬁrst plants to form outposts in bare areas,
such as on soil and rocks. Cyanobacteria have evolved over time by increasing their25 Role of Cyanobacteria in Rhizospheric Nitrogen Fixation 499",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,491
"adaptability to comparatively exposed terrestrial environments and developing ultra-
violet (UV) light –absorbing sheath pigments. A variety of these organisms are found
in soil and different habitats mainly on land, where they are helpful in the function-
ing of ecosystems and nutrient cycling (Severin et al. 2010 ). In addition, marine and
limnic environments are considered cyanobacterial extrusive habitats. They grow infresh/brackish water, in salty water, in hot and cold springs, and in environmentswhere other microalgae cannot survive. Most marine cyanobacteria ﬂourish along
the shore as sea ﬂoor vegetation in the zone between the low and high tide marks. A
large proportion of cyanobacteria are globally distributed in marine plankton.Cyanobacteria are halotolerant; they can tolerate saline environments rather thanbeing halophilic. They can survive in salt concentrations as high as 2 –3% and are
found in salty areas because they can colonize euryhaline environments (Moisander",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,492
"found in salty areas because they can colonize euryhaline environments (Moisander
et al. 2002 ). Fresh water with a distinct trophic environment is an extrusive habitat
for cyanobacteria. Many different species instinctively inhabit and sporadicallyinﬂuence both epilimnic lake water (close to the surface) and hypolimnic lake
water (the deeper layer close to the lake bed). Some survive at the surface by formingmats, which ﬂoat on the water surface, and some adhere to sediments or rocks
(Herrero et al. 2001 ). Cyanobacteria not only survive in fertile environments but also
have an ability to survive on and colonize infertile substrates such as rock or
sediments, desert soil, and volcanic ash. Cyanobacteria have an exceptional ability
to colonize all ecosystem environments on Earth, such as extraordinary cold and hotenvironments, mountain streams, katharobic waters and polysaprobic zones, andAntarctic and Arctic lakes (Alvarenga et al. 2015 ).",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,492
"This shows the successful evolution of cyanobacteria to survive in almost all
ecological habitats on Earth. This successful evolution of cyanobacteria to survive atthe limits of life in the environment has helped to inspire the notion that life couldonce have existed on Mars. The ability of cyanobacteria to adapt to extreme abiotic
stresses includes tolerance of freezing, drought, extreme light exposure (including
high UV-B ﬂux), and low-nutrient oligotrophic conditions.
Cyanobacteria also play major roles in marine ecosystems and in the global
carbon cycle. The marine environment is dominated by Synechococcus and
Prochlorococcus . These two photoautotrophic picoplankton genera are prevalent
throughout the world ’s oceans, where they hold a prime position at the base of the
marine ecosystem food web, potentially controlling carbon ﬂow through the system.

"marine ecosystem food web, potentially controlling carbon ﬂow through the system.
The tiny cyanobacterium Prochlorococcus , which is predominant in the central
Paciﬁc Ocean off Hawaii, may contribute up to 40% of chlorophyll production
and 30% of living carbon, forming a microbial loop, which helps recycle mineralelements. The larger cyanobacterium Synechococcus , which is predominant in the
Sargasso Sea, causes formation of large granules, improving the ef ﬁciency of carbon
export to higher trophic levels (Andreeva et al. 2020 ).
Cyanobacteria are also known for their ability to ﬁx atmospheric nitrogen. These
species are heterocystous biofertilizers in ﬁlamentous forms and belong to the
Nostocales and Stigonematales orders. Eighty percent of rhizosphere isolates are
Anabaena andNostoc . Their oxygen photosynthesis and nitrogenase activity differ500 A. Mishra et al.",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,492
"according to their size, shape and nitrogenase activity, and are generally light
dependent (Syiem et al. 2017 ). Nitrogen- ﬁxing cyanobacteria are mostly found in
the rhizospheres of rice and wheat, and they help promote growth of crops and other
plants. This helps explain the roles of cyanobacteria in marine ecosystem commu-
nities, carbon cycling, and climate modulation. It also highlights the importance ofcyanobacteria in nitrogen ﬁxation and balancing of elements (Prasanna et al. 2009 ).
25.3 The Heterocyst: A Potent Diazotrophic
Cyanobacterial Cell
Organisms that contain diverse cell types acquire various structures, functions, and
behaviors, and are more capable than unicellular organisms. Among multicellularcyanobacteria, the formation of heterocysts provides an example of their cellular andmulticellular pattern arrangements. Many cyanobacteria with distinctive heterocysts
are able to carry out nitrogen ﬁxation under anaerobic conditions. Heterocysts are",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,493
"are able to carry out nitrogen ﬁxation under anaerobic conditions. Heterocysts are
functional cells that ﬁx atmospheric nitrogen, and they are formed in conditions of
nitrogen deprivation by ﬁlamentous cyanobacteria (Kumar et al. 2010 ). The structure
of a heterocyst includes thick cell envelopes and cyanophycin granules at the poles.At the poles, there is an outer polysaccharide layer (HEP) and a heterocyst-speci ﬁc
glycolipid (HGL) layer, which are “laminated ”together, and a narrow cytoplasmic
membrane is visible. It has also been noted that formation of a neck at a heterocystpole occurs only when the pole is adjacent to vegetative cells, so terminal heterocysts
have only one neck (Herrero et al. 2016 ). Cyanobacteria forming heterocysts have

cellular functions plays an important role because cyanobacteria can perform pho-tosynthesis in conditions of oxygen deprivation, but nitrogenase is unstable inaerobic environments. Heterocysts can be distinguished from vegetative cells asthey are bigger, rounder, and less pigmented, and they have heavy tegumentary
layers, thylakoid membranes, and granules at the poles, adjacent to vegetative cells
(Bergman et al. 2007 ). When a source of combined nitrogen is present, Anabaena

which acts as an environmental indicator. In this differentiation, comprehensivealteration of cellular metabolism takes place, changing the earlier structure. Hence,the mother vegetative cell, with phototrophic metabolism, is reconstructed in a
change to photoheterotrophic metabolism, which promotes the activity of nitroge-
nase. All of the functional changes and modi ﬁcations result from formation of an
evolved pattern of genetic expiration (Falcón et al. 2002 ). The heterocyst pattern is
controlled by differentiation into fresh heterocysts through cell division at the center25 Role of Cyanobacteria in Rhizospheric Nitrogen Fixation 501",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,493

can be highly variable. Extreme cellular differentiation is also represented byheterocysts and akinetes (produced only by heterocyst cyanobacteria) in
cyanobacteria, but research has shown that nonheterocystous cyanobacteria have a
more specialized cellular composition for survival in conditions of desiccation andfor nitrogen ﬁxation. Inter ﬁlamentous signaling is used by many different
cyanobacteria for cellular differentiation (Adams and Duggan 1999 ).
25.4 Role of Rhizospheric Cyanobacteria in Nitrogen
Fixation
The term rhizosphere was coined by Lorenz Hiltner (a plant physiologist and
German agronomist) in 1904. The rhizosphere encompasses the plant roots andnurtures a legion of microbes, which bene ﬁt the plant in multitudinous ways, such
as biocontrol and promotion of plant growth and health (Mendes et al. 2013 ). The",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,494
"as biocontrol and promotion of plant growth and health (Mendes et al. 2013 ). The
microbial community is governed by both biotic and abiotic determinants. Theanatomy and the population size of the microbial community depend on the plantand its exudates (Olanrewaju et al. 2019 ). The associated microbes may or may not
directly in ﬂuence the plant and may not always bene ﬁt the plant; they can also be
pathogenic (Vives-Peris et al. 2020 ). Along with the above bene ﬁts, the rhizosphere
also acts as an agent for bioremediation and soil aggregation (Yu et al. 2019 ). The
abundance of the microbiota can be boosted and optimized with good understanding
of the microbiota and their ecology, which is determined by the chemical constitu-
tion and structure of the rhizosphere. The microbiota establish contact with plantroots, ﬁx a multitude of inorganic forms of macronutrients and micronutrients, and
take the lead in regulation of various ecological and mineral cycles (Zanardini et al.2019 ).",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,494
"take the lead in regulation of various ecological and mineral cycles (Zanardini et al.2019 ).
From urea to essential and vital proteins and nucleic acids, nitrogen plays a
signiﬁcant role and is thus essential for survival (Gu et al. 2018 ). It is a prime
constituent of chlorophyll and is crucial for plant growth and production
(Bhattacharyya and Jha 2012 ). Dinitrogen is abundant in the atmosphere, but plants
can utilize nitrogen only when it is in a reduced or oxidized form. These forms areproduced by various microbes, which convert dinitrogen into bioavailable forms(Kant 2018 ). At a industrial level, the Haber –Bosch process is used for ammonia
production. Microbial nitrogen ﬁxation is, however, more ef ﬁcient than the Haber –
Bosch process (Kandemir et al. 2013 ), as it is eco-friendly, conserves energy, and

isRhizobium . Rhizobia are able to form nodules on plants roots as well as in their
stems in certain cases (Bhattacharyya and Jha 2012 ; Dicenzo et al. 2019 ). Efﬁciency

Vanderleyden 1995 ) also helped meet the need for energy in 1970 during the world ’s
energy crisis, which occurred due to dramatic increases in oil prices all over the
world. Scientists therefore utilized solar energy to enhance nitrogen production for
plant growth, and since then it has become an essential part of research on feedingthe world ’s human population by ful ﬁlling the goals of sustainable development,
agriculture, and production. This has led to replacement of fossil fuels with biolog-ical nitrogen ﬁxers, which has proved to be more effective and ef ﬁcient than the
Haber –Bosch process, which depends upon fossil fuels. This is referred to as
community level ef ﬁciency (Masclaux-Daubresse et al. 2010 ; Zanardini et al. 2019 ).

are capable of ﬁxing nitrogen aerobically (like Anabaena ), anaerobically, or
microaerobically (like Plectonemaboryanum ) (Feng et al. 2010 ). However, Frankia
ﬁxes nitrogen for actinorhizal plants only by forming nodules (Sellstedt and Richau
2013 ).
25.5 Signi ﬁcance of Cyanobacteria in Nitrogen Fixation
Cyanobacteria (Haselkorn 2009 ) are competent at ﬁxing nitrogen and are known to
promote healthy growth in plants. Nitrogen ﬁxation involves conversion of atmo-
spheric dinitrogen into ammonia, the assimilatory form of nitrogen, with the help ofenzymes. The process is mediated by microbes and provides nitrogen in waterbodies that are nitrogen de ﬁcient. This is majorly accomplished by cyanobacterial",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,495
"species (Zehr 2011 ). Often, cyanobacterial species face a paradoxical situation, as
they produce oxygen in photosynthesis but the anaerobic process of nitrogen ﬁxation
is highly sensitive to oxygen. For this, diazotrophic taxa and some other taxa ofcyanobacteria have specialized morphological, biochemical, and ecological adapta-
tions. They also have special mechanisms for shielding nitrogenase from inactiva-
tion by oxygen (Ohki et al. 2008 ), such as restricting the process of nitrogen ﬁxation
at night (as photosynthesis does not takes place at that time), forming aggregates andcolonies to decrease illumination, forming microzones with low levels of oxygen,acting as endosymbionts in certain biological associations, and forming heterocysts(in taxa that are ﬁlamentous), which allow them to ﬁx nitrogen, while photosynthesis
is also performed by the same species, reducing the oxygen problem (Berman-Franket al. 2003 ).",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,495
"is also performed by the same species, reducing the oxygen problem (Berman-Franket al. 2003 ).
Trichodesmium lacks heterocysts, yet it is capable of ﬁxing nitrogen during
daytime or the light phase. This fact is currently under investigation; however, it isestimated that nitrogenase is restricted to the subset of cells in the ﬁlament, and these
cells are not known to produce oxygen (Inomura et al. 2019 ).
Nitrogen ﬁxation is a process that requires high energy input (Silsbury 1977 ), as
16 adenosine triphosphate (ATP) molecules are required to ﬁx a single molecule of25 Role of Cyanobacteria in Rhizospheric Nitrogen Fixation 503",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,495
"dinitrogen. However, unlike other nonphotosynthetic nitrogen- ﬁxing bacteria, which
require a redox reaction and organic matter to meet this high energy need fornitrogen ﬁxation, cyanobacteria are capable of meeting this energy need by
photosynthesis.
Cyanobacteria form symbioses with multiple hosts and, unlike rhizobia and other
nitrogen- ﬁxing microbes, these are not con ﬁned to plant roots. Cyanobacteria can
form symbiotic relationships with other parts of plants, and they are not necessarilylocated inside the host plant ’s cells. Cyanobacteria are also capable of ﬁxing carbon
in nonphotosynthetic hosts (Eigemann et al. 2019 ). Since they are facultative
heterotrophs, they are not con ﬁned to the parts of the plant that receive sunlight.
Two paramount attributes of these plant symbionts are that they can differentiate into
specialized nitrogen- ﬁxing cells (heterocysts) and brie ﬂy into motile ﬁlaments",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,496
"Two paramount attributes of these plant symbionts are that they can differentiate into
specialized nitrogen- ﬁxing cells (heterocysts) and brie ﬂy into motile ﬁlaments
(hormogonia) which lack the heterocyst but provides dispersal pathway for othernonmotile cyanobacteria (Pang et al. 2018 ; Schuergers et al. 2017 ).
Cyanobacteria that are symbiotically associated with bryophytes (Adams and
Duggan 2008 ) achieve higher rates of nitrogen ﬁxation than the same cyanobacteria
in a free-living state (Salemaa et al. 2019 ). This is due to a signi ﬁcantly increased
frequency of heterosis, resulting in a nitrogen ﬁxation rate 6 –10 times that achieved
by cyanobacteria in a free-living state. In this state, only 20% of the ﬁxed nitrogen is
retained by the cyanobacteria and the remainder is transferred to the host in the form
of ammonia.

secreted by Anabaena in the cavities of Azolla leaves, and this plays a crucial role
in production of rice (Bidyarani et al. 2015 ). Together, they are widely used
effectively and have been con ﬁrmed as a great source of green manure, especially
in Asian countries, where they are majorly used as a fertilizer, increasing production
of rice by up to 58%. This has made it possible to produce rice year after year and hasled to a decline in dependency on crop rotation, with increments in productivity ofseveral other crops as well.

picocyanobacteria perform photosynthesis in oligotrophic lakes, where they are part
of the microbial food web. These bacteria can also be used as sources of food, animal
feed, fertilizers, and health-related products. They are Gram-negative bacteria and
can cause acute illness, such as gastroenteritis, when cyanobacteria-contaminated
water is consumed.
Cyanobacteria have the ability to store essential nutrients and metabolites in their
cytoplasm (Fig. 25.1). The depletion of nitrogen in the medium increase lipid
production in cyanobacterial cells. The fundamental metabolic process of
cyanobacteria is dinitrogen ﬁxation, and because of this feature, they are considered
the simplest nutritional suppliers of all living organisms. Through use of nitrogenase,
nitrogen is directly converted into ammonium (NH 4) and thereby enters the food
chain.

However, it hasbeen found that various water bodies (mostly lakes) with limited nitrogen have nodominance of nitrogen- ﬁxing cyanobacteria. This could be due to less availability of
light, because huge amounts of energy are required for the nitrogen ﬁxation process.

ions get into the cell by a process of diffusion and are trapped via protonation. Nitrateis taken up by cyanobacterial cells via an active transport system and is sequentiallyreduced to nitrite by nitrate reductase and then to ammonium by nitrite reductase.The glutamine synthetase –glutamate synthase (GS-GOGAT) enzyme system is the
most important pathway for assimilation of ammonium, whether it is suppliedexogenously or generated internally. All nitrogen sources converge in productionof ammonium and glutamine; any physiological differences are related to the
nitrogen source (which depends on the level of ammonium within the cell) or to a

"direct effect of the nitrogen source on the regulation of cell metabolism.
Cyanobacteria accumulate different types of reserves that can be used as sources
of nitrogen, carbon, or both (Allen 1984 ). The cyanobacterial nitrogen reserve is
unique to cyanobacteria but not universally present among them (Liotenberg et al.1996 ). These nonribosomally synthesized polypeptides consist of equimolar quan-
tities of arginine and aspartic acid, which get assembled into granules with amolecular mass ranging from 25,000 to 100,000 kDa (Simon 1971 ,1973 ,1976 ).
Cyanophycin usually accumulates in the cell when growing in excess of other
essential nutrients, such as phosphorus and sulfur, and it decreases under nitrogen-deﬁcient growing conditions, where it serves as a nitrogen source.
According to Carr ( 1988 ), the cyanophycin granule polypeptide is a more
dynamic nitrogen reserve then phycobiliproteins. Glycogen is a major carbon and506 A. Mishra et al.",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,498

growth (Smith 1982 ). Accumulation of this glucose polymer can occur as a result of
nitrogen-limited growth conditions in light or in the presence of an excess of a
utilizable carbon source (Lehmann and Wöber 1976 ). Growth under suboptimal
temperature conditions (van Eykelenburg 1980 ) or with a sudden increase in light
energy input without any changes in nitrogen metabolism can also lead to glycogenaccumulation. In darkness or in light, once the conditions for balanced growth arere-established, glycogen reserves are rapidly depleted to yield energy and carbon forcell metabolism. Glycogen may therefore act as a reserve with the dual functions ofproduct storage and acting as a buffer substance between carbon ﬁxation and carbon
consumption in other biosynthetic pathways.

The supply of assimilable nitrogen in the environment depends on
phycobiliprotein synthesis, and these proteins can serve as a nitrogen reserve(Tandeau de Marsac and Houmard 1993 ). Cyanobacteria that are incapable of ﬁxing
molecular nitrogen respond to nitrogen deprivation by degrading phycobiliproteinsand linker polypeptides that form phycobilisomes, leading to rapid cell bleaching(Liotenberg et al. 1996 ). As was originally postulated by Allen and Smith ( 1969 )
with regard to Anacystis nidulans (Synechococcus sp. PCC 6301), phycocyanin acts
as a nitrogen storage compound in Spirulina platensis . In the marine cyanobacterium

that two elements (carbon and nitrogen), which are most abundant in cell andincreases the coordination mechanism requirement and the second is that nitrogenassimilation is dependent upon carbon skeleton availability for biosynthesis. There-fore, C/N stoichiometry in different organisms varies within a relatively narrowrange; for example, the mass ratio of C/N is 31/4 in phytoplankton because it is the
proper balance for metabolism of carbon and nitrogen and is important for optimal
growth. Different regulation levels exist in different cells to control uptake andassimilation of different nitrogen and carbon sources, whose supply may varyunder different environment conditions (Chellamuthu et al. 2013 ; Herrero et al.

has been made toward answering questions involving cyanobacteria by using themas a model for photosynthetic organisms, and toward summarizing the data andhighlighting the mechanisms underlying signaling and transcriptional regulationinvolved in metabolic control of carbon and nitrogen. Plastids are ancestors ofcyanobacteria (Ponce-Toledo et al. 2017 ); therefore, common features such as

“helpers ”that perform most of the workload in terms of functions, such as high

"25.7.3 Nitrogen Fixation by Moss –Cyanobacterial
Associations
Biological ﬁxation of atmospheric nitrogen is an important pathway for entry of
available nitrogen into an ecosystem. In boreal forests with limited nitrogen, N 2
ﬁxation is performed by cyanobacteria in association with mosses. In these associ-
ations, nitrogen ﬁxation is inhibited by nitrogen input; thus, nitrogen ﬁxation takes
place only in areas with low nitrogen deposition. Laboratory and ﬁeld studies have
shown that arti ﬁcial addition of nitrogen inhibits N 2ﬁxation by moss –cyanobacterial
associations. N 2ﬁxation is affected in different ways by the type and quantity of
nitrogen that enters the system, and by the moisture level in the plant host; moist
conditions promote N 2ﬁxation. Nitrogen is probably leaked by cyanobacteria, but it
is not known whether the nitrogen moves into the soil, how quickly that occurs, andfor how long.

Little background nitrogen deposition occurs in boreal forests (Karlsson et al. 2009 ).
Their soils are characterized by low inorganic nitrogen concentrations, low pHvalues, and low temperatures, which contribute to the limitation of nitrogen in
these system. Mosses play a critical role in boreal forest ecosystems because of
their contribution to habitat heterogeneity (Longton 1988 ) and their effects on the
hydrology, temperature, and chemistry of boreal forest soil (Bonan 1991 ). By
buffering abiotic factors, they can demonstrate high water retention capacity(Dickson 2000 ). Mosses can provide a solid and bene ﬁcial habitat for cyanobacterial

Moss biomass and the activity of cyanobacteria (DeLuca et al. 2007 , 2002;

Molecular Aspects and Oxygen Relations

Abstract The biological reduction of nitrogen is catalyzed by nitrogenase enzyme
which is irreversibly inhibited by molecular oxygen. Cyanobacteria are nitrogen-
ﬁxing organisms that produce oxygen as a by-product of the process of photosyn-
thesis, and which must negotiate the presence of molecular oxygen with an essen-
tially anaerobic enzyme. This chapter draws together an international group of
leading cyanobacterial investigators ’experience and excitement to include a state-
of-the-art review of the area and addresses problems around cyanobacterial life. On
our planet, for quite a long time there have been cyanobacteria. They are mostly
widespread, making them ideal model organisms for the study of microbial bioge-
ography as problems of evolution. Aerobic nitrogen ﬁxation is localized in hetero-",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,512
"widespread, making them ideal model organisms for the study of microbial bioge-
ography as problems of evolution. Aerobic nitrogen ﬁxation is localized in hetero-
cysts and these heterocysts protect nitrogenase from inactivation by atmospheric
oxygen. Cyanobacteria contribute greatly to the primary production of oceans and
are one of the most important groups that release molecular nitrogen. We con ﬁrm
that their pigmentation is due to the strength and sometimes even to the color of the
light available. Others display remarkable life tolerance under anaerobic conditions;
several forms of cyanobacteria thrive at extreme temperatures; other organisms can
endure adverse conditions for long periods in salinity and pH, including when
growth conditions are not acceptable. Many forms of cyanobacteria are simple to

"prokaryotes present in virtually every region of the world and play an important role
in the nitrogen and carbon cycle of the planet. Research efforts in the past 10 yearshave revealed a range of O
2sensitivity of nitrogenase in different strains of
cyanobacteria and a variety of adaptations for the protection of nitrogenase from
damage by both atmospheric and photosynthetic sources of O 2. The most complex
and apparently most ef ﬁcient mechanisms for the protection of nitrogenase are
incorporated in the heterocysts, the nitrogen- ﬁxing cells of cyanobacteria. Several
genetic studies have shown that the controls of heterocyst development and nitro-genase synthesis are closely interrelated and that the expression of nitrogen ﬁxation
(nif) genes is regulated by pO

Speaking about the editors ’invitation for writing this chapter under the title
“Cyanobacteria —Genetics, ecology, and evolution ”never has an introductory chap-
ter covered all aspects. But it has been decided to highlight a number of the subjectsrelating to the cyanobacteria life that fascinate us the most.
Cyanobacteria are an incredibly biologically signi ﬁcant community of interesting
and functional bacteria. The bluish pigment phycocyanin that they use to gather lightfor photosynthesis gives cyanobacteria their name. Chlorophyll A, the same dye
used by plants, is also found. The chloroplast is originally a symbiotic cyanobacte-",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,513

rium of plants picked up from a Precambrian green algal ancestor of the plants.However, all “blue-green ”bacteria are not blue; some different types of phycoery-
thrin are red or pink. These bacteria are sometimes present on greenhouses or aroundsinks and drains. The Red Sea is named for the occasional ﬂowering of a reddish
Oscillatoria species and the roses of Spirulina in African ﬂamingos ( https://ucmp.

"Cyanobacteria are among the ﬁrst species to colonize the planet; these bacteria are
the chloroplast photosynthetic relatives of eukaryotes, such as plants and algae. They
also remove oxygen, live symbiotically in very aggressive conditions, have circadiancycles, exhibit gliding mobility, and can be differentiated by different cell typescalled heterocysts. This makes them perfect model structures to research in simpleprocesses including nitrogen ﬁxation and photosynthesis. Furthermore,
cyanobacteria develop a variety of bioactive substances, some of which can becomenovel antimicrobial agents, anticancer medications, UV protection agents, etc.Throughout recent years the remarkable resilience of cyanobacteria has drawn

"26.1.1 The Cyanobacteria
The“day of blue-green algae ”(Schopf 1974 ) is known as the Precambrian, and
Schopf and Walter (Schopf and Walter 1982 ) called the Proterozoic era –the era of
the cyanobacteria that changed from oxidized to oxygenated by oxygen photosyn-thesis from 2.5 and 0.54 billion years ago, although there is still some debate aboutthe actual presence of the cyanobacteria on Earth. They are really mature creatures. Ithas been demonstrated that the Archean age had oxygen photosynthesis (Knoll1979 ; Olson 2006 ), maybe also more than 3.7 Ga before (Rosing and Frei 2004 ).

nase. This reversible ammonia inhibition is attributed to one subunit of the reductaseof nitrogenase (Gotto and Yoch 1982 ; Reich and Boeger 1989 ). Ammonia is mainly
involved in the management of nitrogen synthetization in all nitrogen- ﬁxing species
by glutamine synthetase at the transcriptional level (Malin and Pearson 1988 ;
Shanmugam et al. 1978 ; Tyler 1978 ). The synthesis of its ingredient proteins is
repressed by oxygen which inactivates nitrogenase irresistibly (Eady et al. 1978 ;
St. John et al. 1974 ). Regulation of ammonia and oxygen nitrogenase synthesis
prevents energy, reducing waste and offsetting the high costs of nitrogen ﬁxation.

A variety of important studies have provided true knowledge of the unique suscep-
tibility of the nitrogen- ﬁxing enzyme mechanism to oxygen. The ﬁrst was the long-
suffering de ﬁnitive proof that ﬁxing nitrogen is a method of reduction and ammonia
is the main component of nitrogen ﬁxation (Bergersen 1965 ; Mortenson et al. 1962 ).
It was also no longer shocking that oxygen interferes with this reaction. Secondly, itwas found that the synthesis of nitrogenase could only occur under aerobic andmicroaerobic conditions in facultative bacteria such as Kiebsiella pneumoniae

nitrogen (Hino and Wilson 1958 ). Then it was shown that also in aerobic Azotobac-

oxygen partial pressure (PO 2) reduced from 0.21 to 0.01 atm (21.27 –1.01 kPa)

which indicates that the rate of nitrogen ﬁxation is still suboptimal under environ-
mental PO 2values, was obtained when the activities in nitrogenase were compared

inhibitor effect of atmospheric oxygen on the ﬁxation of nitrogen was observed.

Oxidation in the nitrogenase proteins would most likely be oxidized by
reactivating oxygen species, such as superoxides, hydroxyl peroxide, or singletoxygen, formed during oxygen reduction (Fridovich 1986 ; Hassam and Fridovich

structure and redox status of the 4Fe-4S clusters (Robson and Postgate 1980 ) seem to
cause a sequence which makes them unable to accept or donate electrons. Oxygencan also cause protease activity, leading to rapid nitrogenase protein degradation

used (Robson 1979 ). It was not because of the relentless degradation of newly
synthesized enzymes, but because of their absence. The separate kinetics fromrepression by ammonia and oxygen caused by synthesis of nitrogenase oxygen,respectively, is suggested for repression.

the excessive development of harmful enzymes. Structural gene products ( nifI,nifD,
andnifK) are all oxygen regulated, and the nifAL operon seems to be part of the
regulation. The nifL gene product functions as a negative regulator, blocking the

unicellular cyanobial bacteria with an excess of nitrogen fastening over the day. Inthe subtropical North Paci ﬁc Ocean, they were ﬁrst recorded to occur in 2001 (Zehr
et al. 2001 ). These photosystem II cells are absent and thus are unable to oxygenate

yet isolated. These species apparently rely on some sort of organic carbon suppliedby other marine ecosystem members that have not already been described. In fact,
most cyanobacteria are obligatory photoautotrophs (Smith et al. 1967 ), but some
species have demonstrated optional photoheterotrophy, includingchemoheterotrophy. Heterotrophic cyanobacterial development, at least in labora-tory culture, is thus precedented. We are also completely ignorant of the interrelationbetween this new aquatic way of life and the other species found in the sea (Botheet al. 2011 ; Tripp et al. 2010 ; Zehr et al. 2008 ).

Many cyanobacteria may be put within a column of water or inside a benthic
microbial mat to provide light conditions; the best attainable are nutrients and
other environmental parameters. Two methods for achieving this goal are essentiallyavailable: passive movement cell booster control and active motility at energy cost.
Some cyanobacteria were already recognized in the nineteenth century for the
existence of “carbon vacuoles ”—gas vesicle clusters. The ﬁrstﬁndings were possi-
bly from 1895, when three publications reported the ﬂoodplain of numerous water
bacteria and the resistance to strain of gas vesicles (Ahlborn 1895 ; Klebahn 1895 ;

the vesicles to represent the concentration of gases absorbed in the liquid water in agas mix. Gas vesicles can be regulated per cell to increase or decrease cell buoyancy(Walsby 1987 ,1981 ,1994 ). Among the genres, the distribution of Microcystis and

Oscillatoria and Spirulina, which follow the rotation of the trichoma around itsaxis, are known for their remarkable motions. The motion direction can be caused

strong substratum being present. The most popular mode of active movement isﬂagella; the prokaryote universe, for cyanobacteria, has yet to be known. It was
therefore a major surprise to discover marine single-cell Synechococcus which swim
in the water actively, without the need for solid surface conditions (Waterbury et al.1985 ). The presence of ﬂagella or other cell structure associated with locomotion

26.2 Effect of Oxygen on Nitrogen Fixation
Early experiments with free-living nitrogen- ﬁxing organs as well as with symbiotic
structures have demonstrated the inhibitory in ﬂuence of atmospheric oxygen on
nitrogen ﬁxation (Bergersen 1962 ; Bond 1961 ; Hamilton and Wilson 1955 ; Meyer-

hof and Burk 1928 ; Parker and Scutt 1960 ). A variety of important results have
contributed to a clear understanding of the unique intense susceptibility of theenzyme- ﬁxing mechanism to oxygen. The ﬁrst was the long-seeking de ﬁnitive
proof that a signi ﬁcantly reduction mechanism is nitrogen ﬁxation and that ammonia
is the main component of nitrogen ﬁxation (Bergersen 1965 ; Dugdale et al. 1961 ). It
was also no longer shocking that oxygen interferes with this reaction. Secondly, itwas noted that the synthesis of nitrogenase could only occur in anaerobic andmicroaerobic environments with facultative bacteria, including Klebsiella
pneumoniae (Klucas 1972 )o r Bacillus polymyxa and microaerophilic organics
(Grau and Wilson 1963 ), such as Mycobacterium ﬂavum , whereas, when supplied

more proof that also in aerobic Azotobacter bacteria, oxygen inhibits nitrogenase
activity. In Burk the ef ﬁciency of the nitrogen ﬁxation (N

improved between 10 and 20 times by 0.21 to 0.01 (21.27 to 1.01 kPa) with reducedpartial oxygen pressure (PO

obtained when nitrogenase activity was plotted against PO 2, and this suggests that
the rate of nitrogen ﬁxation is currently suboptimal under ambient PO 2values
(Dalton and Postgate 1969 ). All of this was particularly unexpected for Azotobacter

pasteurianum (Carnahan et al. 1960 ) or a simply aerobic Azotobacter vinelandii, has
been eliminated in the same way (Bulen and LeComte 1966 ; Bulen et al. 1965 ).
Nothing less susceptible to oxygen is found in autotrophic nitrogen- ﬁxing species
(Gallon 1980 ). In extreme anaerobic conditions, the most photosynthetic bacteria are
nitrogen ﬁxed only in the sun. One exception to this is Rhodobacter capsulate that is
able to sustain nitrogenase Rhodopseudomonas capsulate exposed to air (Meyeret al. 1978 ; Willison et al. 1983 ), but at a very low dose. Continuous spreading using
an anaerobic gas mixture to avoid the inactivation of nitrogenase by photosynthetic532 D. Upadhyay et al.",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,523

nitrogenase is greatly increased with decreased concentrations in the culture mediumof dissolved oxygen in all heterocyst cyanobacteria (Stewart 1971 ). Nitrogenase
isolated from cyanobacteria has been shown to be extremely susceptible to oxygen
(Fay and Cox 1967 ; Haystead et al. 1970 ). In the chemical metabolic process,
Xanthobacter autotrophicus willﬁx nitrogen under air when CO
2is reduced with
H2as an energy source and when sucrose is heterotrophically produced as a carbon
and energy source. The nitrogen- ﬁxing behavior relation is nevertheless close to that
of the Azotobacter species in the above case (Dalton 1980 ). Results produced with
free-living nitrogen- ﬁxing species were veri ﬁed by experiments of symbiotic struc-

inhibited at higher oxygen concentrations in non-leguminous root nodules (Bond1961 ; Silver 1969 ). Therefore, an anaerobic life is more consistent with nitrogen
fastening than is rational to assume. The hypothesis may support the theory thatduring the early years of the earth ’s existence the nitrogenase mechanism evolved as
in the simple atmosphere oxygen was most likely missing (Broda and Peschek 1983 ;
Schopf and Walter 1982 ; Sprent and Raven 1985 ). The application of oxygen to all
portions of the nitrogenase complex is unstable irreversibly (Burris et al. 1980 ;

tions are highly vulnerable to oxygen due to the increased oxidation of air and thehalf-life of dinitrogenase. Mo-fe protein dinitrogenase is less prone to a half-life inthe air of 4.5 –10 min. Mo-Fe is, however, much more oxygen-labile than reducing
dinitrogenase (Eady et al. 1980 ; Shah and Brill 1977 ). Oxidation of nitrogenase
proteins is likely to lead to a more reactive oxygen compound, including superoxide,hydrogen peroxide, hydroxyl radicals, or single oxygen (Fridovich 1986 ; Hassam

Oxygen inactivates not only nitrogenase but also inactivates and stops nitrogenasereplication. The lowest PO
2is required in Azotobacter spp. to suppress nitrogenase
synthesis. Yet, it is twenty times stronger than nitrogenase inactivation (Postgate
et al. 1981 ). The cells of K. pneumoniae were not present with both dinitrogenase
and dinitrogenase reductase (St. John et al. 1974 ). After oxygen absorption,
chroococcum is used. The different kinetics of ammonia and oxygen suppressionhave shown that their loss can help not only to degrade new synthesized enzyme butalso to inhibit the synthesis by oxygen.

to regulate nifl and inhibits the accumulation of oxygen from other nif operons (Ditta

mutants found that transcriptional controls are controlled independently and onvarious levels by combined nitrogen and oxygen. The ﬁrst stage of tracking includes
nitrogen sensing and signaling. The nifLA promoter is believed to be able to feel thechromosome supercoiling condition (Eady et al. 1978 ; Kranz and Foster-Hartnett

Cyanobacterialdefense processes are the key focus in this analysis and will be further discussed
below. A short survey can, however, provide a valuable framework for a comparison

nitrogen anaerobically. The choice of sub-atmospheric oxygen levels in nitrogen

26.2.2 Diffusion of Controlled Oxygen
The key mechanism for nitrogenase defense in bacteroid root nodule is oxygen ﬂow
regulation. Leghemoglobin is now well known for low oxygen transport in legumi-nous root nodules ’contaminated cells (Hill 1971 ). The system is improved by
membrane limitations that provide barriers to diffusion and minimize oxygen ﬂow,534 D. Upadhyay et al.",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,525
"and even by hydrogenase activity the mechanic is also improved (Bergersen 1980 ;
Layzell et al. 1990 ; Sheehy and Bergersen 1986 ).

The criteria for nitrogenase activities are de ﬁned in oxygen-dependent breathing in
aerobic nitrogen- ﬁxing species under conditions occurring to be in con ﬂict with the
oxygen lability of nitrogenase. The ef ﬁciency of nitrogen ﬁxation in Azotobacter
spp. was noted by Meyerhof and Burk (Meyerhof and Burk 1928 ). PO 2is shaped
differently. Bacteria spp. A rise in dissolved concentrations and other aerobicdiazotrophs may react to the breath volume; oxygen maintains low intracellular
oxygen levels and preserves the nitrogenase against inactivation (Dalton and

2shifts is due to
the oxygen-sensor mechanism (Peterson 1989 ) and can involve various components
of the respiratory system, such as dehydrogenase NADH/NADPH and cytochromea2 (Robson and Postgate 1980 ). The respiratory reaction becomes nonlinear at
higher oxygen pressures (Post et al. 1983 ), suggesting additional defensive mecha-
nisms (Dingler and Oelze 1987 ; Kuhla and Oelze 1988 ). However, under natural
conditions even with a limited amount of dissolved oxygen concentrations, breath-
ing protection can be ideal for scaling up surplus oxygen and for maintaining
nitrogenase in a practically oxygen-free cellular atmosphere (Hochman and Bums1981 ).

Dixon notes that hydrogenase absorption is multifold (Dixon 1972 ): it destroys N 2

"26.2.5 Protecting Enzymes from Reactive Oxygen Sources
The development of reactive oxygen compounds, such as superoxide radicals (O 2),
but also hydrogen peroxide (H 2O2) and hydroxyl radical (HO-), results in a univalent
reduction of O 2. These organisms are speci ﬁcally connected to PO 2in the cell. The
reactive sources of oxygen have a very toxic impact on biological processes and willsigniﬁcantly affect the degradation of not only nitrogenase but also many other
important cell constituents. The primary defensive mechanism to prevent possibleoxygen toxicity is superoxide dismutase (Henry et al. 1978 ), which catalyzes the
elimination of superoxide radicals. Catalases, which mediate their conversion to
H
2O and O 2, can dissolve hydrogen peroxide. The use of other devices to shield
nitrogenase from oxygen inactivation in aerobic and microaerophilic diazotrophicsseems to play a signi ﬁcant role for antioxidant enzyme (Dingler and Oelze 1987 ;",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,527

26.3.1 Unique Problem in Cyanobacteria with Nitrogen

15 years of in-depth studies to make sure they are oxygen protected (Becana and536 D. Upadhyay et al.",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,527
"Rodriguez-Barrueco 1989 ; Gallon 1981 ; Hallenbeck 1987 ; Kallas et al. 1983 ). The
complicated nitrogen- ﬁxing cell, the heterocyst, explains diverse and ef ﬁcient mech-
anisms from reasonably simple, largely unicellular cyanobacterial strategies. Indirect
transition evidence is possible, according to the evolutionary picture, because of the
steady growth in oxygen content of the atmosphere between simple and increasinglycomplex processes (Broda and Peschek 1983 ; Giovannoni et al. 1988 ; Holland 1990 ;

After Wyatt and Silvey (Wyatt and Silvey 1969 )ﬁrst reported that Gloeothece sp. is
able to ﬁx aerobic N 2, several attempts were made to clarify, in photosynthesis, that
the function of nitrogenase is preserved under air and apparently in O 2cells (Gallon

between the cells grown on dinitrogen and those cultivated with combined nitrogenwere not observed during light and electron microscopic testing (Gallon et al. 1974 ).
The fact that nitrogenase was slightly more susceptible to O
2when induced anaer-
obically than air is clearly suggested by the involvement of defensive mechanisms.
The existence of O 2(Kallas et al. 1983 ) is needed to articulate these mechanisms.

of simultaneously producing O 2andﬁxing N 2and the pathways used by N 2ﬁxers
can be especially well developed in cyanobacteria to shield nitrogenase from O 2.
Heterocyst cyanobacteria spatially distinguish oxygen (vegetative cell) and N 2
(non-photosynthetic heterocysts) from oxygen (vegetative cells). Some ﬁlamentous
cyanobacteria launch a differentiation program after hungering for nitrogen, whichleads to heterocyst creation. These cells form the positions of N

nitrate or ammonium state, cyanobacteria do not synthesize, and it is clear that

graphical representation of the ancestral history of genes or animals. The pattern of abranching tree demonstrates evolutionary relations between the strains (topology).26 Molecular Aspects and Oxygen Relations of Nitrogen Fixation in Cyanobacteria 547",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,538
"The nodes and edges of a tree are formed. The nodes ﬁt the organisms and the
boundaries indicate their relationships. For the terminal nodes, there is only one linkedge that corresponds to species. These are commonly referred to as taxonomic
operating units (OTUs). Three connecting edges have internal nodes which corre-
spond to a possible ancestor of one collection of species. The root of the tree, thecommon ancestor to all taxa, is a special inner node with two edges only.
Phylogenetic trees may be re ﬂected as rooted or unrooted. Rooted or unrooted
trees are identical, with the exception of having just two edges connected while theyare absent in the latter (Fig. 26.4). The two approaches proposed for tree building

Algorithmicmethods are referred to as distance methodologies since a tree computes the distancebetween pairs of sequences using a distance matrix. An algorithm based on distanceis simply a process to construct a tree that is matrix dependent. If the tree is to beadditive, all distances should be followed by three rules: (1) only zero if two pointswith the same points must be distances, (2) there are symmetrical distances, and(3) no tree shortcuts occur, i.e., a –c cannot surpass the a –b and b –c combined

While N 2attachment is largely based on energy and power reduction formed in
luminous reactions in heterocyst-forming cyanobacteria, the nitrogenase reaction
itself is light independent (Cox 1966 ; Cox and Fay 1969 ). Several strains are able to
use heterotrophic metabolism to generate organic substrates (mainly sugars) and to
steadily, however, set N 2in the darkness (Allison et al. 1937 ; Fay 1965 ; Khoja and
Whitton 1975 ). And in obligatory photoautotrophs, including A. The N 2cylinders
will continue to be ﬁxed in the dark until endogenous carbon reserves formed in the
preceding photosynthesis are available (Bottomley and Stewart 1977 ; Cox and Fay

activity concentrations in the dark are signi ﬁcantly lower than in the sun. The
intrinsic lack of energy and/or reduction to sustain the full fastening of N 2

deleted. The gene product is responsible for the maturation of the enzyme complex

26.8 Evolutionary Considerations
Owing to the scarcity of geological and fossil sources and their inconclusive
existence, our understanding of primordial environments and the earliest life forms
is based mainly on geophysical and geochemical considerations (Bernal 1967 ;
Margulis 1982 ; Schopf and Walter 1982 ). The primordial environment possibly
had a diminished disposition and then transformed into a redox-neutral state until itgot aerobic (Broda and Peschek 1983 ). According to a broadly reasonable theory,
theﬁrst living species are widely thought to have been heterotrophic anaerobes",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,546
"theﬁrst living species are widely thought to have been heterotrophic anaerobes
reliant on their metabolism of geochemically generated organic matter. Nitrogen inplentiful quantities is often expected to exist in their lowest form, ammonia, which is
used by older microorganisms for cell content biosynthesis. As nitrogenase synthesis
is suppressed by ammonia and oxygen, the evolution of nitrogen ﬁxation seems
logical to suppose that the simultaneous depletion or restricted supply of nitrogenﬁxation followed it. The power to stabilize N
2, close to the present clostridia, was
ﬁrst obtained by ancient fermenters. Still now anaerobic and voluntary bacteria have
a more common ability to be used for N 2ﬁxation than aerobic bacteria (Postgate26 Molecular Aspects and Oxygen Relations of Nitrogen Fixation in Cyanobacteria 555",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,546

the exhaustion of organic nutrients in the ancient oceans from related reasons. Thereis compelling indirect proof to support the opinion that the prehistoric atmosphere
was nearly anoxic around two billion years ago (Cloud 1974 ; Holland 1990 ). The O
2
atmosphere contents were only roughly 0.2% in advance of the evolved oxygenic
photosynthesis, with many, if not most, of the old cyanobacteria inherited andtransported details on nitrogenase synthesis. The creation of O

brian era, and the further path of bio-development was decided more than any othercircumstances. The amounts of atmospheric O

cyanobacterial evolutionary relations. Its ﬁndings indicate that signi ﬁcant eubacte-
rial lines, including phototrophic anaerobic bacteria, have differed.

"26.9 Conclusion and Future Perspectives
Geological documents and phylogenetic studies on the basis of 16S mRNA indicate
that N 2ﬁxation during cyanobacteria evolution followed oxygen photosynthesis.
The primary need to defend nitrogenase from O 2has therefore been published. The
production of oxygen photosynthesis and inhibitory concentrations at atmosphereO
2may have occurred inside the same cell in ancient cyanobacteria at the same time.
We may conclude that certain systemic and/or biochemical mechanisms were
established in this early period to avoid intracellular stress of O 2. As the concentra-
tion of O 2in the environment has steadily been raised, there is also a need to protect
the nitrogenase from outside O 2distributed to N 2-ﬁxing cells. Any diazotrophic
cyanobacteria acquired additional, effective nitrogenase defense mechanisms.Others, unable to adapt, might only repair N
2in a microaerobic climate or in",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,548
"cyanobacteria acquired additional, effective nitrogenase defense mechanisms.Others, unable to adapt, might only repair N
2in a microaerobic climate or in
oxygen-free environments. Over the past two decades, studies have found a numberof oxygen tolerances in response to O
2stress among diazotrophic cyanobacteria and
great diversity. It is tempting to speculate that this difference represents the phases of
cyanobacteria ’s tolerance to O 2atmosphere enrichment.
In the 10 years since our understanding of biochemistry and genetic stability for
cyanobacterial N 2attachment has improved dramatically in the physiology and
ecology of N 2cyanobacteria, our perception of nitrogenase defense in
non-heterocyst cyanobacteria, however, has advanced relatively slowly, from its26 Molecular Aspects and Oxygen Relations of Nitrogen Fixation in Cyanobacteria 557",ts/Soil Nitrogen Ecology.pdf,548

solution to such problems (e.g., the cellular function of nitrogenase activity atphotosynthesis site and the transport mechanisms of breathing electrons, distribution
of reduced substances and ATP to light and darkness, and a spatial and/or temporal
distinction between photosynthesis and activity of nitrogenase within cells andhuman trichomes) is sought. Latest studies on the presence of conformationaldefense linked to reversible modi ﬁcation of dinitrogenase reductase show inade-
quately yet de ﬁnitely more closely connected to other possible mechanisms includ-
ing oxygen reaction and enzyme safety, besides light-based O

bioengineering, there can be no longer an illusion regarding the possibilities ofartiﬁcially forming stable cyanobacterium –crop plant connexions (Gantar et al.

minimize requirements for chemical fertilizers.

Soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks have been greatly depleted across the globe by con-
version of wetlands to croplands, agroforestry, and urban areas. Here, we investi-
gated SOC distribution and turnover in four land use types: a wetland, cropland,
forestland, and construction land in the Baiyangdian Wetland, Northern China. The
C : N ratios were up to 1.70-times larger in cropland, forestland, and construction
land than in the original wetland because of faster N losses compared to C following
wetland conversion. The δ13C values of SOC increased with depth in wetland, and
showed an overall depletion compared with the other three land use types. Acid-to-
Aldehyde ratios of syringyl in wetland were 0.72 –1.14-, 0.72 –1.72-, and 1.18 –-",ts/Land Degrad Dev - 2020 - Xia - Soil organic matter turnover depending on land use change Coupling C N ratios 13C and.pdf,0

lignin decomposition rate in wetlands. The βvalue was defined by the slope of the
linear regression between the logarithm of SOC and δ13SOC values, and decreased
from cropland over construction land and forestland to wetland, reflecting the faster
SOC turnover with the lower βvalues. However, SOC content and storage were up
to 2.29- and 2.07-times higher in wetlands than in soils of other land use types. The

"1||INTRODUCTION
Anthropogenic disturbances such as land use change (Don,
Schumacher, & Freibauer, 2011; Yu, Lu, Tian, & Canadell, 2019,
including deforestation (Fujisaki, Perrin, Garric, Balesdent, &Brossard, 2017), agriculture (Poeplau & Don, 2015), and urban devel-
opment (Sica, Quintana, Radeloff, & Gavier-Pizarro, 2016) have very
strongly depleted SOC stocks with a substantial release of CO
2into
the atmosphere (Sanderman, Hengl, & Fiske, 2017). Based on a meta-
analysis, including 160 sites of 7 land use change types in 29 countries,
C stocks were found to be reduced at the average rate of0.39 Mg ha
−1yr−1across all land use changes (Deng, Zhu, Tang, &
Shangguan, 2016). Wu, Guo, and Peng (2003) assessed that land use
change decreased SOC by approximately 7.1 Pg during 1997 –2007
because of average SOC density decreases of 0.8 kg C m−2for culti-
vated soils within semiarid/semihumid areas. Zhu et al. (2020) showed
that conversion (>60 years) of two marshes to cropland decreased",ts/Land Degrad Dev - 2020 - Xia - Soil organic matter turnover depending on land use change Coupling C N ratios 13C and.pdf,1
"vated soils within semiarid/semihumid areas. Zhu et al. (2020) showed
that conversion (>60 years) of two marshes to cropland decreased
SOC storage by up to 3.1-times at 0 –30 cm depth in Northern China.
The conversion of peatland to flooded forest accelerates the decom-
position of plant litter and SOC in tropical wetlands and thus influ-
ences SOC pools in wetlands (Sjögersten et al., 2014). However, Postand Kwon (2000) reported that SOC sequestration increased at an
average of 33 t C ha
−1yr−1during the 100 years following farmland
conversion into grasslands and forests. Therefore, whether thedecrease or increase in the SOC stocks by land use changes dependson the change types and conversion chronosequence.
Wetlands cover only /C246% of the Earth's land surface and store
about one-third of the total SOC pool in terrestrial ecosystems,whereas more than 70% of C is stored in the top 100 cm (Nahlik &

"about one-third of the total SOC pool in terrestrial ecosystems,whereas more than 70% of C is stored in the top 100 cm (Nahlik &
Fennessy, 2016). Half of the world's wetlands have been degraded,
altered, or even lost owing to anthropogenic activities over the past150 years (Hu, Niu, Chen, Li, & Zhang, 2017; Kirwan &
Megonigal, 2013; Zhao et al., 2016). The contribution of land use
change to anthropogenic CO
2emissions is about 12 –15% of total
anthropogenic emissions at a rate of 1.2 Pg yr−1(Deng et al., 2016).
For example, land use change contributed approximately 36% of the
anthropogenic CO 2emissions into the atmosphere during 1985 –2000
(Houghton, 2007). Wetlands are one of the most important types ofterrestrial ecosystems suffering from land use change. Losses of SOC
in wetlands caused by land use change through human activities are
one of the greatest sources of anthropogenic C emissions (Petrescuet al., 2015). Thus, it is urgent that we better understand how these",ts/Land Degrad Dev - 2020 - Xia - Soil organic matter turnover depending on land use change Coupling C N ratios 13C and.pdf,1

land conversions influence soil physicochemical properties controlling
the SOC dynamics.
Stable carbon isotope signature ( δ
13C) and C : N ratios are power-
ful tools to elucidate sources, mixing and transformations of SOC in
terrestrial, estuarine, coastal, and marine soils (Khan, Vane, &Horton, 2015; Sasmito et al., 2020). The δ
13C composition can pro-
vide evidence of SOC turnover (Guillaume, Damris, &
Kuzyakov, 2015; Zhao et al., 2019), because plant residues are the
main source of SOC, and δ13C also reflects the combined effects of
the residues δ13C signature and consecutive fractionation processes
(Brüggemann et al., 2011; Guinina & Kuzyakov, 2014). Monitoring ofδ13C of SOC through land use change provides an effective approach",ts/Land Degrad Dev - 2020 - Xia - Soil organic matter turnover depending on land use change Coupling C N ratios 13C and.pdf,1
"(Brüggemann et al., 2011; Guinina & Kuzyakov, 2014). Monitoring ofδ13C of SOC through land use change provides an effective approach
to appraise microbial decomposition rates and organic matter turn-over (Blagodatskaya, Yuyukina, Blagodatsky, & Kuzyakov, 2011;
Drollinger, Kuzyakov, & Glatzel, 2019; Guinina & Kuzyakov, 2014;
Wang, Wei, et al., 2017). The C : N ratio is another important indicatorof the quality and degree of SOC degradation (Batjes, 2014), espe-
cially in wetlands (Drollinger et al., 2019). Ratios of C : N in soils usu-
ally changes in response to land use changes, and thus reflect SOCstability and decomposition that further affect SOC storing capacity
(Wang, Sardans, et al., 2014).
Empirical models showed a significant fit of linear regression
between the logarithm of SOC content and its δ
13C for most of the
soils worldwide. The slope of the linear regression (defined as the β
value) indicates a proxy for SOC turnover (e.g., Acton, Fox, Campbell,",ts/Land Degrad Dev - 2020 - Xia - Soil organic matter turnover depending on land use change Coupling C N ratios 13C and.pdf,1

nounced negative slope (the βvalue) is indicative for C isotopic frac-
tionation during decomposition and physical mixing processes of SOCturnover across cold temperate to tropical forests. Wang, Wei,

"Lignin is one of the most abundant components of higher plants in
terrestrial ecosystems and represents an important part of plant-derived
C input into soils. Because of the high litter input into soils and thechemical recalcitrance (abundant aromatic structures), lignin is consid-
ered as an important source of SOC (Zhu et al., 2019). Lignin contains a
suite of single-ring phenol compounds, including vanillyl (V), syringyl (S),and cinnamyl (C). The contents and ratios of these phenol compounds
are biochemical indicators of sources and state of decomposition of lig-
nin and SOC (Thevenot, Dignac, & Rumpel, 2010).
Early studies of SOC turnover were based on bulk proxies such as
C : N ratios and δ
13C and δ15N in response to land use changes
(Andrews, Greenaway, & Dennis, 1998; Del Galdo, Six, Peressotti, &Francesca Cotrufo, 2003; Geissen et al., 2009; Zhang, Dang, Zhang, &Cheng, 2015).

in sink regions into a labile pool in source regions. Biomarker can pro-vide a detailed information in describing SOC molecular composition
and stability, increasing the ability to distinguish the SOM sources
after one land-use conversion to other systems (Fisher et al., 2003).Recently, the application of lignin biomarkers to wetland systems has
increased dramatically, and the combination of lignin monomer com-
position, C : N ratios, and δ
13C has contributed substantially to our
cognition to study the SOC stocks, stability and sources under land
use changes.

the North China Plain (Figure S1). The mean annual precipitation
(MAP) and mean annual temperature (MAT) are 564 mm and 12.1/C14C,
respectively. The rainy season is mainly in June –August. The warmest
month is July, and coldest month is January. Land use types in this
area are mainly wetland, cropland, forestland, and construction land(Table 1; Zhang, Gong, Zhao, & Duo, 2016).
2.2 ||Sample collection
Field sampling was conducted in September 2018. Before the sam-
pling, the land use history was investigated integrated with field inter-views with local leaders and villagers, and land use database. Three
independent replicate sites were selected for each land use type, a
total of 12 sampling sites. We gathered general background informa-tion of each sampling site by consulting with farmers or land-owners
to select replicates with similar management practices (Table 1). Each",ts/Land Degrad Dev - 2020 - Xia - Soil organic matter turnover depending on land use change Coupling C N ratios 13C and.pdf,2

independent replicate soil is a mixed soil homogenized from threesubsamples (with a distance of <50 m). Soil samples were collected at
the depths of 0 –10, 10 –20, 20 –30, 30 –40, 40 –60, 60 –80, and
80–100 cm using a soil auger. Before the analysis, visible stones and
root residues were removed. Soil samples were air-dried in the shadeat room temperature, then gently ground and sieved through a
0.15 mm sieve.
2.3 ||Soil carbon fraction and nitrogen analysis
Bulk density (BD, g cm−3) was determined by the cutting ring method
(100 cm3) and weighting the dry weight. Soil samples (about 0.50 g)
were acidified with 1.0 mol L−1HCl (20 mL) to remove carbonates, and
then washed 3 –4-times with distilled water until neutral reaction. The
content of TC, TN in bulk soils and SOC in acidified soils were measured",ts/Land Degrad Dev - 2020 - Xia - Soil organic matter turnover depending on land use change Coupling C N ratios 13C and.pdf,2

content of TC, TN in bulk soils and SOC in acidified soils were measured
using an Elementar Vario EL III (Elementar Analysensysteme, GmbH,Germany). The SIC content was estimated by subtracting the SOC con-tent from TC content. The equation is as follows:

The stable carbon isotope signature ( δ13C ratios) were measured
using elemental analysis-continuous flow mass spectrometry(Finnegan MAT253, Thermal Electron Corporation, Waltham, MA).
The value of stable carbon isotope ratio (
13C/12C) is usually expressed
in parts per thousand ( ‰) relative to PDB (Pee Dee Belemnite). Rela-
tive isotope abundances are denoted as δ-values, which is calculated
using the following equation:

"construction land slightly decreased TC contents. The TC contents
below 40 cm were almost equivalent for all land use types (13.8 –-
15.7 g kg−1) (Figure S2A). While land conversion from wetland to
cropland, forestland and construction land decreased TN contents
by 7.87 –37.0, 23.0 –29.0 and 17.3 –37.1% in all depths, respectively.
Thus, the TN contents of all land use types also decreased withdepth, and the decrease degree of TN contents was stronger than
TC contents. Construction land has the lowest TN contents in the
top 40 cm and cropland had the lowest TN contents below 40 cm(Figure S2B).

"Land conversion from wetland (solely C3 plants) to cropland
(C4 and C3 plants in rotation), forestland (solely C3 plants) and con-struction land (no plants) increased the δ
13C values of SOC, especially
in 0–60 cm. The δ13C values increased with the depth in wetland;
while decreased in cropland; the δ13C values increased above 30 cm
in forestland, then it did not vary evidently below 30 cm; for construc-
tion land, the δ13C values overall kept a slight decline in the different
soil layers (Figures 1d and S3C).
The slope of the linear regression between the logarithm of SOC
andδ13C values of SOC (defined as the βvalue) indicates a proxy for
SOC turnover (Figure 2a). The wetland had the lowest βvalues
(−3.54), followed by forestland ( −2.13) and construction land ( −0.21),

4||DISCUSSION
4.1 ||Effects of land use change on soil organic
carbon distribution
SOC content is considerably depleted after wetland conversion to
other land use types, which is consistent with other studies(e.g., Fenstermacher, Rabenhorst, Lang, McCarty, & Needelman, 2016;Guillaume et al., 2015; Hopkinson, Cai, & Hu, 2012; Jinbo, Chang-
chun, & Shenmin, 2007). The percent of SOC in TC was more than
70% in the topsoil (0 –30 cm), and decreased to ≤50% below the
30 cm in wetland. The proportions of SOC in wetland were far more
than the other three land use types, which were especially evident in
the subsoil (Figure S6). Based on our investigations, when wetland isconverted to cropland, crop biomass is usually manually or mechani-
cally removed (e.g., crushed to feed livestock or burnt for heating),",ts/Land Degrad Dev - 2020 - Xia - Soil organic matter turnover depending on land use change Coupling C N ratios 13C and.pdf,5
"cally removed (e.g., crushed to feed livestock or burnt for heating),
which resulted in a very strong reduction in the input of plant resi-dues. Mechanical tillage disrupts soil aggregates and thus accelerate
the SOC decomposition via exposing organic macromolecules to air or
biological attack (Aziz, Mahmood, & Islam, 2013; Choudhuryet al., 2014). Although forestland is natural and human disturbancesare very small, the arid conditions may not be conducive to the accu-
mulation of SOC in North China. In addition, the substances
decomposed faster under aerobic conditions, especially for complexand phenolic compounds (Yu, Xie, Khan, & Shen, 2019). For

"construction land, the decrease in SOC input originating from plant lit-
ter would be the primary reason for limiting SOC accumulation, and
the percentage of SOC in TC is less than 30% (Figures S6 and S7).
Moreover, a lot of organic materials from subsoil and inorganic carbonfrom parent materials were lost faster under local construction
processes.
The differences in SOC contents above 30 cm are caused by the
sources from vegetation inputs. However, we found the decrease
degree of SOC contents below 30 cm was also equivalent than that
above 30 cm when wetland is converted to cropland, forestland, andconstruction land (Figure 1b), which indicated that SOC in subsoil canalso be reduced by land use changes (Wiesmeier et al., 2012). Surface
soil is exposed to air and thus subjected to the intensive aerobic
decomposition, while deeper soil in wetlands is generally subjected toanaerobic decomposition due to high water contents (Wang, Song,",ts/Land Degrad Dev - 2020 - Xia - Soil organic matter turnover depending on land use change Coupling C N ratios 13C and.pdf,6
"decomposition, while deeper soil in wetlands is generally subjected toanaerobic decomposition due to high water contents (Wang, Song,
et al., 2012). The decay of detritus under anaerobic environments is
much slower than under aerobic conditions (Page, Rieley, &Banks, 2011), which resulted in a larger SOC accumulation in deeper
layers compared to other land use types. The dissolved organic carbon
(DOC), root biomass, and root exudates are the primary SOC sourcesin subsoil (Hafner & Kuzyakov, 2016; Rumpel & Kögel-Knabner, 2011).
IPCC (2003) recommended soil sampling depth of 30 cm for evalua-
tion of SOC change with land use change. Most investigations(e.g., Chen et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2018) of SOC losses after landuse change only focused on the topsoil (0 –30 cm), where contained
high SOC contents and was mainly affected by human disturbance
and environmental factors. The changes of C pools in the top 30 cmare likely to be fast enough to be detected (IPCC, 2003). Thus, current",ts/Land Degrad Dev - 2020 - Xia - Soil organic matter turnover depending on land use change Coupling C N ratios 13C and.pdf,6
"and environmental factors. The changes of C pools in the top 30 cmare likely to be fast enough to be detected (IPCC, 2003). Thus, current
studies often ignored the SOC dynamics in subsoil. Generally, SOChas a turnover time up to hundreds or thousands of years in deep soils
and is relatively stable in response to land use change (Hou, Chen,Chen, He, & Zhu, 2019). Previous investigations (e.g., Huo
et al., 2018; Ma et al., 2016; Sheng et al., 2015) have also demon-
strated that SOC in subsoil can be decreased when wetland wasconverted to other land use types. We found SOC storage in the sub-
soil (30 –100 cm) was much higher than that in the topsoil (0 –30 cm)
for four land use types (Figure 1c), which implies the capability ofSOC storage in subsoil. The global estimate of SOC storage was in the
range of 684 –724 Pg of C in the top 30 cm, and 1,462 –1,548 Pg of C",ts/Land Degrad Dev - 2020 - Xia - Soil organic matter turnover depending on land use change Coupling C N ratios 13C and.pdf,6
"range of 684 –724 Pg of C in the top 30 cm, and 1,462 –1,548 Pg of C
in the top 100 cm (Batjes, 2014), thus subsoil could have the potentialto sequester high SOC amounts (Salome, Nunan, Pouteau, Lerch, &Chenu, 2010; Poeplau & Don, 2013). Therefore, only focusing on sur-
face soil would give an incomplete estimation for the SOC changes
after land conversion. We recommend that soil sampling depth infuture studies should be up to 100 cm to assess changes of SOC
stocks through land use changes.
The time scale of wetland conversion years is different and not
precise (Table 1). SOC content and storage overall decreased with the
conversion period after wetland conversion to forestland and con-
struction land, but not to cropland (Table S1), but the decrease wasnot linear with the age of wetland conversion. This agreed with other
studies (e.g., Cui et al., 2014; Deng et al., 2016; Wang, Liu,",ts/Land Degrad Dev - 2020 - Xia - Soil organic matter turnover depending on land use change Coupling C N ratios 13C and.pdf,6
"studies (e.g., Cui et al., 2014; Deng et al., 2016; Wang, Liu,
et al., 2012), for example, Wang, Liu, et al. (2012) reported bothorganic carbon in bulk soils and water-stable aggregates decreasedafter native wetland conversion to cultivated cropland, and the age of
16 cultivation years was regarded as the threshold point of short- and
long-term effects. Concluding, potential of SOC sequestrationdepends not only on the age of wetland conversions, but also on con-
version types, initial soil properties of original wetlands, hydrological
conditions after conversions, and climate factors on a global scale.

"in wetlands compared with the other three land use types, however,
wetland had the highest SOC contents. Similarly, Powers and Schle-singer (2002) have reported that SOC content was inversely propor-
tional to the SOC decomposition rate. In our study, dry –wet cycles
often occur in wetland, and the sampling sites were not in the peren-nial flooded environment (the water level is about −80 cm, even
below −100 cm). Thus, the lower C : N ratios and favorable water
content may contribute to the reproduction of aerobic microorgan-isms, and further accelerates SOC decomposition and nutrient avail-
ability including aggregate destruction and increased SOC
mineralization (Denef et al., 2001; Gao et al., 2016; Harrison-Kirk,Beare, Meenken, & Condron, 2014). Jiang et al. (2013) also demon-strated that the SOC decomposition rate was negatively related to

C : N ratio also indirectly indicates the SOC sources. A lower C : N
ratio can indicate organic matter from the sea sources
(Redfield, 1963), while a higher C : N ratio can indicate organic matterfrom terrestrial sources (Naik, Naqvi, & Araujo, 2017). Algae typically
have C : N ratios from 5 to 8, while vascular terrestrial plants have the
C : N ratios higher than 15 (Meyers, 1994). However, the soil C : Nratios ( /C2410:1) in study wetland were in the middle of terrestrial
organic matter and marine sediments, which indicated a mixture of
terrestrial and few marine sources. This is because Baiyangdian Wet-land is largely a lake through which run many rivers that finally flowinto the ocean, and the topography is formed by the repeated evolu-
tion of the lake and the ocean (Chen et al., 2017; Wang, Min, Dong,

Theδ
13C values of surface soils directly reflect C inputs from cur-
rent plant litter (Bird, Veenendaal, & Lloyd, 2004), but have a small
isotopic shift due to13C fractionation by microbial transformations
(Werth & Kuzyakov, 2010). The δ13C composition of plants is mainly
controlled by their photosynthesis type (i.e., C3 or C4) and is also
influenced by environmental factors (Kohn, 2010; Wang et al., 2013).Plants via the C3 photosynthetic pathway have δ
13C values varying
from−22‰to−32‰(mean, −27‰), while δ13C values of C4 plants
vary from −9t o−17‰(mean, −13‰) (Alonso-Cantabrana & von
Caemmerer, 2016). The average δ13C value in wetland was −24.2‰,
which was within the range of the δ13C values for general C3 plants.

It implied that SOC was mainly sourced from the input and decompo-

Baiyangdian Wetland. Importantly, the δ13C values of C3 plants in
wetter conditions are likely to be more depleted δ13C than those in
drier regions (Bowling, Pataki, & Randerson, 2008), because highhumidity/precipitation can increase and strengthen stomatal conduc-
tance while to increase the Pi/Pa ratio (Farquhar, O'Leary, &
Berry, 1982). Therefore, δ
13C values in wetland soils were relatively
more negative than other land use change types (Figure 1d). Themaize (C4) –wheat (C3) rotation has been used by farmers in croplands

"13C values could
be partly ascribed to the increased proportions of C4 plant-derived Cin soils when converted from wetland to cropland, especially in the
tillage horizon. For the forestland soils, it was in the middle of wetlandand cropland, because all woody plants belong to C3 plants. The aver-
ageδ
13C values in construction land were equivalent to wetland, but
were enriched in δ13C in the topsoil and depleted δ13C in the subsoil,
and this is because no plants are growing in the construction land
converted from wetland.
δ13C of SOC generally increases with soil depth (e.g., Brunn,
Spielvogel, Sauer, & Oelmann, 2014; Guillaume et al., 2015; Wang,
Wei, et al., 2017). δ13C changes with soil depth are related to four
processes: (a) physical mixing (Bird et al., 2004; Brunn et al., 2014),
showing that it increased promoted homogenization of soil column
based on one process-based modeling, and in return decreased theδ

is one commonly held cognition that isotopic fractionation often
occurs during microbial decomposition (Guinina & Kuzyakov, 2014).Microbes degrade
12C more readily than13C during SOC decomposi-
tion (Lerch, Nunan, Dignac, Chenu, & Mariotti, 2011), and thus the
residual SOC is enriched more13C components in deeper soil layers
(Diochon & Kellman, 2008; Guinina & Kuzyakov, 2014). The ratio of
bacteria to fungi increased with soil depth, which may be beneficial to

of lower C : N ratios and suitable water conditions for microbes inwetlands. In our sites, the water level was about −80 cm in wetland,

"turnover rates and faster microbial decomposition rates result in lower β
values (Acton et al., 2013). In our study, the βvalues increased from
wetland < forestland < construction land < cropland, which indicated the
turnover rate of SOC was wetland > forestland > construction land-
> cropland. This is completely contrary to C : N ratios of
wetland < construction land < forestland < cropland. Similarly, Zhao
et al. (2019) proposed that the C : N ratios was a determinant factor that
explained 67.5% variance of the βvalue. Wang, Wei, et al. (2017) also
identified a significant relationship between the C : N ratio and βvalue.
Microbial decomposition is faster in soils with lower C : N ratios, which
decreases the βvalue (Acton et al., 2013). Therefore, low C : N ratios are
interrelated to the SOC decomposition rate with lower βvalues. Con-

"cluding, the δ13C integrated with C : N ratios is an effective method to
distinguish the sources and decomposition of SOC that determines the β
value for characterizing SOC dynamics through land use changes(Figure 7). However, whether βvalue under complex ecosystems can beused to constrain decomposition rates and controls on SOC turnover is
yet to be explored at the large regional and global scale.
4.3 ||Effects of land use change on lignin
distribution characteristics
The SOC stability also depends on labile and recalcitrant fractions,
and their molecular structures. Relative to a labile C, the dominant
proportion of SOC is the recalcitrant (Lian et al., 2018). Lignin is con-
sidered as a recalcitrant organic C due to its nonhydrolyzable C C
and C OC bonds and the richness of aromatic structures (Crow
et al., 2009). Therefore, lignin is generally considered to be an impor-
tant indicator for assessing SOC quality and long-term SOC
sequestration.

"The sum (V + S + C) and their characteristic ratios, including the

(a quantitative measure of lignin), increased with SOC content
(R

unique biochemical classes that make up different maternal vegeta-tion carrier as well as the geochemical stability of specific biochemi-
cals under different land use types (Fisher et al., 2003). The Ad-to-Al
ratio is an indicator of the lignin degradation state, that is, the Ad-to-Al ratios of V and S units will increase accompanied by the increase of

"soils under forestland and in construction land were between 0 –0.05
and 0.35 –1.20, and thus the sources of lignin phenols are derived
from the complex of woody angiosperm tissue (A w) and nonwoody
angiosperm tissue (A nw) (Figures 5 and 6). Both C/V and S/V decrease
with the depth (Figure 5), reflecting the decreasing contribution ofplant litter to lignin accumulation in subsoil (Figure 7). Consequently,
despite lignin sources differ between vegetation types, and the
decomposition led to similar lignin characteristics in soils, onlyinherited some differences in (Ad/Al)
sand C/V from the lignin sources
in plant litter (Wang, Tian, et al., 2017). These processes diminish the

formations in soils (Bore, Kuzyakov, & Dippold, 2019; Wickings,Grandy, Reed, & Cleveland, 2012).
In all plant tissues, lignin is
13C depleted by 2 –6‰compared with
the whole-plant material and by 4 –7‰compared with cellulose
(Benner, Fogel, Sprague, & Hodson, 1987). A negative relationship
between the contents of VSC phenols and δ13C (Figure 4b) is caused
by the differences in the decomposition degree of individual plant lit-ter components. The polysaccharides are degraded 2 –5 times more
quickly than the lignin, which result in the gradual enrichment of plant
detritus in lignin-derived C (Rejmánková & Houdková, 2006).

land altered the quality of organic C inputs and hydrological condi-
tions. The C : N ratios and δ13C values increased with soil depth in

"tions. The C : N ratios and δ13C values increased with soil depth in
wetland, and were overall lower than other three land use types. The
(Ad/Al) sand C/V from the lignin sources in soils increased when wet-
land was converted to other three land use types. The C : N ratios,δ
13C, and soil lignin composition characteristics explained large pro-
portions of the variance in lowest βvalue in wetland, and lower β
value is characterized as higher SOC turnover. Wetland had the
highest SOC content and storage. Based on our field investigations,this is caused by litter inputs (e.g., plant litter quality and biomass),
hydrological conditions (e.g., drying –wetting cycles, unflooded condi-
tions) and soil physicochemical properties (e.g., C : N ratios) and lead-ing to large variance in SOC turnover rate. The C : N ratios, δ
13C, and
lignin monomer composition are combined tools to evaluate the
sources, decomposition and SOC turnover in response to land usechanges.

"vious mechanic researches have demonstrated the different release rates of nutrients in different stages, e.g., the 
fast-leaching stage (in initial 4–10 days), the microbe conditioning stage with slow decay rate (from winter to 
spring with low temperature). Nevertheless, models for predicting these processes are still not available and the 
conventional used model inherently assumes a constant relative release rate. Here, we conducted a one-year in- 
situ decomposition experiment using the conventional (net) litterbag technique. The credibility of experimental 
data is increased by using fresh debris to avoid alternation of material traits caused by the conventional drying 
pretreatment, which is originally used in experiments for terrestrial debris. Our results demonstrated that the

"carbon release process showed an obvious three-stage pattern, which can be universally depicted by a piecewise

(ki, i denote i th decomposition stage), which variate greatly between different stages, with k1/k2 >11.8 and k3/ 
k2 >2.63. More importantly, k3 can be further conveniently decomposed into microbe-induced k3-1 and 
macroinvertebrate-induced k3-2, correspondingly. Also, k3-2 showed an exponential increase with the number of 
macroinvertebrate (r2 >0.95). The contributions of the microbe and macroinvertebrate can then be depicted by 
these two parameters. In conclusion, our model greatly increases the model realism and generality in simulating

mechanistic study of the impacts of environmental factors (e.g., pH, dissolved oxygen) on k1, k2, k3-1 and k3-2 
concerning different kinds of macrophyte, in which the parameters k1, k2, k3-1 and k3-2 acts as important 
ecological indicators in depicting the relative release rates caused by specific driving forces. These ecological

1.Introduction 
The carbon (C) cycle in ecosystems has received increased interest 
due to its impacts on the climate change (Bai and Cotrufo, 2022 ). In past 
decades, significant research has been conducted to investigate the C 
cycle in terrestrial ecosystems (e.g., forest, grassland and farmland)",ts/C release.pdf,0
"decades, significant research has been conducted to investigate the C

(Krishna and Mohan, 2017; Walker et al., 2018; Zeng et al., 2022; Bai 
and Cotrufo, 2022 ) and aquatic ecosystems (e.g., wetland, river, lake) 
(Xie et al., 2016; Xiao et al., 2017; Tang et al., 2018; Luo et al., 2020 ). 
During vegetation growth, large amounts of carbon are stored in the vegetations (Yang et al., 2023; Qiu et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2018; 
Zhang et al., 2021; Dai et al., 2020 ) and C gradually return to the soil or 
sediment pool during the deposition (Seastedt et al., 1992; Krishna and 
Mohan, 2017 ) or potentially release to the atmosphere (Zeng et al., 
2022 ) as carbon source (Wohl et al., 2017 ). This process is especially

cesses during macrophyte decomposition are generally not clear, and the 
early exponential decaying model (Olson, 1963 ) was commonly used to 
represent the nutrient release process (e.g., Xiao et al., 2017 ), which 
inherently assume a constant relative release rate throughout the 
decomposition. However, previous studies have indicated that nutrient 
release is rapid during the initial 4 days of macrophyte decomposition 
caused by rapid leaching of soluble material (Tukey, 1970; Fischer et al., 
2006; Zhang et al., 2018; Luo et al., 2020 ), followed by a slower nutrient 
release stage dominated by microbial metabolism (Shilla et al., 2006; 
Han et al., 2019; Zhao et al., 2021 ). Also, previous researchers have 
documented that microbial metabolism could increase with the increase 
of the temperature (Godshalk and Wetzel, 1978; Migliorini and Romero,",ts/C release.pdf,1
"documented that microbial metabolism could increase with the increase 
of the temperature (Godshalk and Wetzel, 1978; Migliorini and Romero, 
2020; Zhao et al., 2021 ). Some research also mentioned the important 
impacts of the fragmentation of macroinvertebrates (e.g., Luo et al., 
2020 ). All of these researches demonstrated that the relative release rate 
cannot be constant, hence the simple exponential model might be not 
suitable to be used in modelling the carbon release processes. Thus, 
more realistic models should be developed, but this could be achieved 
only when the more realistic experimental data is available. 
Net litterbag (or litter bag) experiments are the most effective 
methods in the field decomposition experiment for macrophyte (Bocock 
and Gilbert, 1957; Wardle et al.1997; Chen et al., 2021; Spohn and Berg, 
2023 ). However, all the previous researches still used the drying pre-

decomposition researches. For aquatic vegetations, this drying pre-
treatment inevitably decrease the credibility of experiments by intro-
ducing this additional drying and rehydration processes: Previous 
researches (e.g, Zhang et al., 2018 ) showed that the treatment of drying 
and rewetting cycles can accelerate the decomposition rate of leaf litter.

2.1. Site description 
The field experiment was conducted in Wulaingsu Lake 
(40◦36′ 41◦03′N, 108◦43′ 108◦57′E), the largest lake in the Yellow 
River Basin in China (366 km2) (Fig. 1) (Yang et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 
2021 ). This lake is primarily fed by irrigation water (5.7 ×108 m3) from 
Hetao Irrigation regions. Eighty-one percent water was inflowed 
through the Total Drainage Outlet (4.6 ×108 m3) of drainage regions, 
and only 10 % water is discharged through the single lake outlet (located",ts/C release.pdf,1
"through the Total Drainage Outlet (4.6 ×108 m3) of drainage regions, 
and only 10 % water is discharged through the single lake outlet (located 
in the southernmost sub-lake as shown in Fig. 1) to the Yellow River 
(Yang et al., 2019 ). Wuliangsu Lake developed into a typical MDE lake 
after the 1990 s. Phragmites australis (emergent macrophyte) extends to 
60 % of the area, and annual senescent biomass amounts to 1.0 ×105 t 
(dry mass, leaf/stem ratio is 1:6.5) (Hei et al., 2019 ), which divide the 
lake into 13 sub-lakes. These sub-lakes are primarily connected by 
narrow constructed net channels. Apart from the southernmost sub-lake, 
>90 % of the area in open sub-lakes are covered by dense Potamogeton 
pectinatus L. (submerged macrophyte). Among these sub-lakes, West sub- 
lake is most seriously affected by the inflowed irrigation water, while 
East sub-lake, as nature reserve, is the least disturbed by human activity.

washed free of sediment. P. australis detritus was separated into leaf and 
stem after collection. The P. pectinatus detritus was cut into two sizes 
(approximately 50 cm and 5 cm) after cleaned for convenience to assess 
the role of physical fragmentation. Each section was mixed thoroughly 
to ensure homogeneous content of moisture and total carbon (TC). The

3.1.1. AFDM loss ratio (%) 
For P. pectinatus , AFDM loss processes can be generally divided into 
three stages (Fig. 2). AFDM losses in the 0–4 days amounted to almost 
16.45 ±3.39 % in East sub-lake and 16.43 ±4.07 % in West sub-lakes, 
respectively. The decomposition rate becomes much smaller in the 
second stage, with total AFDM loss of 28.19 ±2.43 % (in East sub-lake) 
and 30.29 ±5.05 % (in West sub-lake) in the 4–200 days, respectively. 
During the period of previous two stages, AFDM loss ratio showed no 
significant difference between East sub-lake and West sub-lake. How-
ever, in the third stage, the AFDM loss in West sub-lake (47.84 ±4.96 %) 
was significantly higher than that in East sub-lake (37.30 ±4.05 %).

rapid AFDM loss of 13.0 –15.8 %, followed by a slow variation stage 
similar to P. pectinatus , with 26.7 –28.3 % AFDM lost in the second stage 
(4–160 d). However, P. australis leaf stepped into the third stage early in 
160 d, and AFDM loss accounted to almost 56.9 –58.0 % in the third 
stage. 
P. australis stem is resistant to the decomposition. The mass loss rate 
was much lower than that of P. australis leaf and P. pectinatus. Only 
approximate 58 % of the AFDM were lost during the studied period.

TC remaining ratio showed a similar variation with AFDM remaining 
ratio for all treatments as shown in Fig. 3. For P. pectinatus , TC released 
rapidly in the initial short 0–4 days: the total release accounted for 16.77

ever, the release rates showed an obvious increase in the third stage, and 
TC release in West sub-lake (48.97 ±4.71 %) were significantly higher 
than that in East sub-lake (34.84 ±4.72 %). 
For P. australis leaf, TC release rate showed similar variation with 
that of AFDM throughout the three stages. Also, little difference of TC 
release existed between East sub-lake (13.21 %, 26.38 % and 59.66 % in 
each stage, respectively) and West sub-lake (15.62 %, 26.05 %, 57.38 %, 
respectively). Only less than 1 % TC remains in the debris at the end of 
third stage. However, TC release from P. australis stem are significant 
slower, especially in the first stage, with only<1 % TC released in East 
sub-lakes. Also, almost 55 % TC remains in the macrophyte debris at the 
end of third stage.

2) TC contents 
As shown in Fig. 4, TC contents did not exhibit similar variation with 
the biomass loss. In the initial 0–4 days, TN contents in P. pectinatus 
exhibits an obvious increase of 20.93 –41.26 mg/g (in East sub-lake) and 
of 23.28 –43.07 mg/g (in West sub-lake), separately. P. australis leaf also 
exhibits similar variation trends, with 20.93 –41.26 mg/g and 
23.28 –43.07 mg/g increase in East and West sub-lake, separately. But 
the TC contents increase in P. australis stem was small (<4 mg/g). In the 
second stage, TC contents for all treatments showed a small decrease of 
7.66 –41.82 mg/g (in East sub-lake) and 19.94 –52.73 mg/g (in West sub- 
lake). TC contents decreased again in the third stage (160 d for leaf, and

likely occured when there was the large mass loss for all treatments. 
3.1.3. Eco-environment conditions 
The water temperature in each time is shown in Table 2. We can see 
that water temperature was>20 ℃ during 200–310 d. It should be also 
noted that, during this time, large numbers of macroinvertebrates were 
found in the litter bags. Number of macroinvertebrates in West sub-lake 
(xn,W) was generally larger than that in East sub-lake (nx,E), with xn,W/nx, 
E of 11.47 ±6.62. 
3.2. Three-stage release model 
Our results indicated that, during the initial several days, rapid loss 
occurred for both debris mass and TC, followed by comparatively slower 
variation in second stages, and then the loss rate is increased again in the 
third stage until reaching equilibrium. Thus, we propose a piecewise 
function using universal exponential decline formula,

It can be seen from Fig. 6 and Table 3 that, for all treatments, r2 >

piecewise function can clearly depict the AFDM loss and TC release 
processes in all three stages. 
3.3. Contributions of key factors for ki and modeling  
1) Correlation of AFDM loss and TC release 
Correlation analysis of parameters (wi and ki) in Eq. (2) between TC 
and AFDM indicated a high correlation between TC release and AFDM 
loss, with r2 >0.96 in first two stages and r2 >0.99 in third stages. From",ts/C release.pdf,3
"and AFDM indicated a high correlation between TC release and AFDM 
loss, with r2 >0.96 in first two stages and r2 >0.99 in third stages. From 
this we can infer that TC loss mainly caused by the debris decay. But TC 
contents showed an increase both in the first and in the third stage, 
which coincide with large mass loss periods. This means that TC loss rate 
is slower than AFDM loss rates. Also, in the third stage, the water tem-
perature increased up to 20 ℃, which is favorited for the growth of 
microbe and microbial C might also contribute to an important part of 
the TC contents increase (Carvalho et al., 2005; Zhu et al., 2022 ).  
2) Contributions of key factors for ki.

k1/k2 >11.8 and k3/k2 >2.63 for all treatments except for P. australis

West sub-lake; but 3) there is significant difference for k3 between East 
and West sub-lakes for submerged macrophyte, with k3,W/k3,E >1.41. 
Also, it should be noted that no significant difference was observed 
between treatments for fragmentation size (5 and 50 cm) and mesh size 
(0.5 and 1.0 mm).For the three stages, the variation pattern in first two 
stage can be well explained by the previous literatures: the first stage 
dominated by rapid leaching of soluble material (Fischer et al., 2006; 
Zhang et al., 2018; Luo et al., 2020 ) and the second stage is mainly 
dominated by microbial metabolism (Han et al., 2019 ). However, the 
third stage with a rebounded k3 was seldom mentioned. Previous re-
searchers have documented the important impacts of temperature on the 
microbial metabolism (Godshalk and Wetzel, 1978; Migliorini and

because no difference of temperature exists between these two sub- 
lakes. Fortunately, this difference become explainable when the signif -
icant difference of macroinvertebrate between the two sub-lakes was 
considered; During the third stage, the number of macroinvertebrates in

5treatments. More importantly, it offers us the opportunity for modeling 
the contributions of the macroinvertebrates based on the response of TC 
release rate to the macroinvertebrate number in different litter bags for 
P. pectinatus . Here, P.australis samples were not considered because the 
mass loss in P. australis samples is not sensitive to the macroinvertebrate 
numbers, with much smaller difference of k3 between the two sub-lakes.  
3) Modeling for k3 
Non-linear analysis showed that k3-k2 follows an exponential in-
crease with macroinvertebrate number (xN) for P. pectinatus samples: 
k3 k2=aebxN(3)  
where b is the relative increase rate of k3-k2 with xN, and a is equal to k3- 
k2 when no macroinvertebrate participates (xN =0). The coefficients of 
Eq. (3) for both TC and AFDM were shown in Table 4. 
Thus, k3 can be further decomposed into two parts: microbe domi -
nated rate (k3-1) and macroinvertebrate dominated rate (k3-2)",ts/C release.pdf,4

3.4. Merits and limitations 
3.4.1. Merits  
1) Improvements in realism and accuracy of our model 
Until now, almost all previous literatures (e.g., Zhang et al., 2008; 
Han et al., 2019; Vitale et al., 2019; Song and Jiang, 2020; Pan et al., 
2021 ) directly used Olson ’s single exposure model (Olson, 1963 ) to 
model the nutrient release processes. Although our results fall in line 
with the previous literature in that carbon release processes show a 
similar variation pattern with the decomposition processes, our results",ts/C release.pdf,4

6demonstrate a three-stage decomposition pattern: discrepancy of the 
relative decomposition rate between different stages amounts to 2–11 
folds. This discrepancy certainly cannot be modeled by Olson ’s single 
exposure model which inherently assumes constant relative decompo -
sition rate, but can be well modeled by a three-stage exponential model 
as detailed in Section 3.2. Also, prediction of the impacts of in-
vertebrates on the decomposition rate becomes possible: if the number 
of invertebrates (xN) is known, the relative decomposition rate k3-2 can 
be calculated based on the Eq. (6).  
2) Transition towards mechanistic model 
Mechanistic effect models have long been identified as potentially 
useful tools to extrapolate the limited findings from standard tests to 
more realistic conditions (Forbes et al., 2010; Thorbek et al., 2010 ). 
However, unlike physics models, most of the ecological model are",ts/C release.pdf,5
"more realistic conditions (Forbes et al., 2010; Thorbek et al., 2010 ). 
However, unlike physics models, most of the ecological model are 
empirical models and the mechanism is generically unclear due to lack 
of knowledge for mechanism, resources of money or time. When the 
model is applied to the working conditions with different driving factors 
or different scale, they might lead to erroneous decisions (Augusiak 
et al., 2014 ). The single exponential model assumes a constant relative 
release rate at different stages, which could not reflect different driving 
factors, so the model completely lost the mechanism attribute. In our three-stage model, the relative decomposition rate of different stages 
can reflect the impacts of different dominant driving factors. Even in the 
complex third stage, the key drive forces of both microorganisms and 
macroinvertebrate are successfully to be modeled by Eqs. (5)–(7). This",ts/C release.pdf,5
"complex third stage, the key drive forces of both microorganisms and 
macroinvertebrate are successfully to be modeled by Eqs. (5)–(7). This 
increases the capacity of our model to reproduce observations for the 
right reasons, not just to tweak the parameters via calibration to do the 
right thing.  
3) Potential use of our models 
The model can be applied in two aspects. Firstly, the model can be 
used to predict the carbon release during the macrophyte decomposition 
after the model parameters are calibrated with measured data under 
similar conditions; Secondly, the models k1, k2, k3-1 and k3-2 can be used 
as important ecological indicators to characterize the carbon release rate 
driven by factors of leaching, microbes and macroinvertebrates. This 
facilitates further mechanical researches.

"3.4.2. Limitations and challenges 
Models are simplified representations of real systems (Augusiak 
et al., 2014 ). Despite of large progresses in both model realism and 
mechanism for our model, the limitations still cannot be ignored. 
Firstly, the model realism still restricted by the data realism. The data

7credibility has been greatly increased by using the fresh debris without 
the conventional drying pretreatment in our experiments. However, all 
debris used in the experiments is harvested before placed in the net litterbag, which is not the case in nature decomposition. This harvest 
treatment will certainly introduce some deviation for the carbon release 
processes, especially for the leaching processes. However, this limitation 
is seldom stressed and has not been solved in our work. 
Secondly, although all parameters of k1, k2, k3-1 and k3-2 have explicit 
physical meaning, the response of the value of these parameters to the 
environmental factor (e.g., pH, dissolved oxygen, temperature, et al) is 
still not clear. Thus, this model still needs to be calibrated for the pa-
rameters before used in predictions, and the calibrated parameters is 
practical only in specific regions with similar environmental conditions. Table 3",ts/C release.pdf,6

84.Conclusions 
In our work, we have developed a three-stage carbon release model, 
which is capable to depict the variation of carbon release processes in 
different stage during macrophyte decomposition. Model accuracy 
increased greatly, and the mechanism become clearer, but limitations 
still exist. In the near future, it is crucial to conduct experiments to 
investigate the mechanistic impacts of environmental factors on k1, k2, 
k3-1 and k3-2, which act as important ecological indicators for the relative 
carbon release rate caused by different driving forces, and thereafter 
further increase the model accuracy and generality. This work seems 
huge and tedious, but the stake is high in developing a high mechanic 
model.

Inorganic carbon and fossil organic carbon are source of bias for
quantiﬁcation of sequestered carbon in mine spoil

Charles University, Faculty of Science, Institute for Environmental Studies, Czech Republic (olga.vinduskova@gmail.com)
Carbon sequestration in mine soils has been studied as a possibility to mitigate the rising atmospheric CO 2levels
and to improve mine soil quality (Vindušková and Frouz, 2013). Moreover, these soils offer an unique opportunity
to study soil carbon dynamics using the chronosequence approach (using a set of sites of different age on similar
parent material).
However, quantiﬁcation of sequestered carbon in mine soils is often complicated by fossil organic carbon (e.g.,
from coal or kerogen) or inorganic carbon present in the spoil. We present a methodology for quantiﬁcation of both",ts/Inorganic carbon and fossil organic carbon are source of bias for mine pool.pdf,0
"from coal or kerogen) or inorganic carbon present in the spoil. We present a methodology for quantiﬁcation of both
of these common constituents of mine soils. Our recommendations are based on experiments done on post-mining
soils in Sokolov basin, Czech Republic. Here, fossil organic carbon is present mainly as kerogen Type I and II and
represents 2-6 wt.% C in these soils. Inorganic carbon in these soils is present mainly as siderite (FeCO 3), calcite
(CaCO 3), and dolomite (CaMg(CO 3)2). All of these carbonates are often found in the overburden of coal seams
thus being a common constituent of post-mining soils in the world.

Inorganic carbon is an important carbon source of autotrophic bacteria, e.g., ammonia-oxidizing bacteria.
Ammonia-oxidizing bacteria are chemoautotrophic bacteria with carbon sequestration capacity. Experimentswere performed on partial nitri ﬁcation sludge with di ﬀerent inﬂ uent matrices, and optimal experimental op-
erational conditions were established. The carbon ﬁxation pathway of ammonia-oxidizing sludge was de-
termined via
13C isotope tracers and qPCR. The denitri ﬁcation eﬀ ect was better when the NH 4+-N, HCO 3–,C a2+,
Mg2+, and microbial accelerant concentrations were 15, 250, 113, 100 and 1 mL/L, respectively. The nitrite
accumulation rate reached 96.95%.13C isotope tracing showed that13C abundance in sludge increased sig-

organisms. The functional gene cbbL, which follows the Calvin cycle carbon sequestration pathway, was iden-

1. Introduction
Anaerobic ammonia oxidation (anammox), a relatively new auto-

& Zhang, 2016; Lackner et al., 2014; Strous et al., 1998; Yamamoto
et al., 2007).
Partial nitri ﬁcation is a preprocess in anammox and uses ammonia-
oxidizing bacteria (AOB) to oxidize a proportion (about 56%) of NH 4+-
N in wastewater to NO 2–-N under aerobic conditions ( Wei et al., 2018 ).
It is a necessary pretreatment, because anammox depends on the con-
centration ratio of NH 4+-N to NO 2–-N in in ﬂow water. Anammox bac-
teria convert NO 2–-N and residual NH 4+-N to nitrogen under anaerobic
conditions, thus shortening the redox process from NH 4+-N to N 2
(Kartal et al., 2010). Therefore, partial nitri ﬁcation is key to the suc-
cessful operation of anammox to e ﬃciently produce NO 2–-N from
sludge. The key microorganisms in the combined process of anammoxand partial nitri ﬁcation are AOB and anammox bacteria, which are
chemoautotrophic microorganisms ( Strous et al., 1999a ). They can use",ts/Carbon sequestration pathway of inorganic carbon in partial nitrification sludge.pdf,1
"chemoautotrophic microorganisms ( Strous et al., 1999a ). They can use
inorganic carbon (IC) as a carbon source for their own cell synthesis, so
they have a certain carbon sequestration capacity ( Wang et al., 2018 ),
so that the process of anammox and partial nitri ﬁcation does not need
additional organic carbon sources ( Jetten et al., 2002). In partial ni-
triﬁcation, IC is not only an important carbon source for bacterial as-
similation but also plays an important role in the regulation of bio-
chemical reactions, e.g., microbial activity ( Guisasola et al., 2006 ).
Therefore, AOB activity can be promoted by the addition of IC, andNO
2–-N can consequently be e ﬃciently produced during partial ni-
triﬁcation.
Hitherto, ﬁve CO 2ﬁxation pathways have been identi ﬁed, namely
the pentose phosphate cycle (Calvin cycle), reductive acetyl coenzymeA pathway, 3-hydroxypropionate bicycle, reductive tricarboxylic acidcycle, and 3-hydroxypropionate/4-hydroxybutyrate and 4-hydro-",ts/Carbon sequestration pathway of inorganic carbon in partial nitrification sludge.pdf,1

xybutyrate cycles ( Benson & Calvin, 1950; Buchanan & Arnon, 1990;
Ragsdale, 1991; Shively et al., 1998; Sylvia et al., 2002 ). The Calvin
cycle is the main CO
2-ﬁxation pathway in photoautotrophic micro-
organisms and chemoautotrophic bacteria ( Ragsdale, 1991). Ribulose
1,5-diphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase is the key enzyme controlling
the cycle rate. The properties of the enzyme are directly related to the
ﬁxation rate of atmospheric CO 2.
Rubisco and its coding gene cbbL have been extensively studied in
laboratory environments. By using isotope tracing and determining
enzymatic activity, Stefan (2004) inferred that di ﬀerent AOB could
have the same carbon ﬁxation pathway, possibly the Calvin cycle or

However, few studies have been done on the carbon sequestration

2. Materials and methods
2.1. Inoculated sludge and test water
The in ﬂuent water was arti ﬁcially simulated wastewater. Matrix
conditions with di ﬀerent substrates were divided into four groups:
NH4+-N, IC, Ca2+and Mg2+, and microbial accelerant (Ruicheng
Environmental Protection Consulting Company, Weifang, Shandong,
China), named groups A to D, respectively. The microbial accelerant
was based on enzymatic enhancers, which can enhance the activity of
biological reactions and promote proliferation ( Wang et al., 2019).
These four groups were subdivided into four more groups ( Table 1). The
inﬂuent pH was adjusted by 0.5 mol/L NaOH and 0.5 mol/L H 2SO4
buﬀer solutions ( Zhang & Jin, 2017). The inoculated sludge in the ex-
periment was a partial nitri ﬁcation sludge domesticated and cultured in",ts/Carbon sequestration pathway of inorganic carbon in partial nitrification sludge.pdf,1
"buﬀer solutions ( Zhang & Jin, 2017). The inoculated sludge in the ex-
periment was a partial nitri ﬁcation sludge domesticated and cultured in
the laboratory ( Jin et al., 2015). Partial nitri ﬁcation performance was
tested by using the nitrite accumulation rate (NAR). The closer the NAR
is to 100%, the better the partial nitri ﬁcation e ﬀect is ( Dong et al.,
2013 ). The NAR in this study was > 99%.
2.2. Experimental setup
This study used a sequencing batch reactor, and the material was
plexiglass ( Ma et al., 2019). Three groups of parallel reaction devices
were used. The volume of the reactor was 0.5 L, the hydraulic retentiontime was 1.5 h, and the temperature, pH, and dissolved oxygen were
maintained at 32 ± 1 °C, 7.5 –7.8, and 0.5 mg/L, respectively, via
water bath heating ( Jin et al., 2015 ).Fig. 1 schematically illustrates the
device and experimental setup.

The siphon method was used for the test water intake and outlet. To
let water in, one end of the intake pipe (silica gel tube) was connected
to the intake of the device and the other end to the arti ﬁcial waste-
water. When the water was discharged, the silica gel tube was placed inthe supernatant, and the outlet was sealed during the operation of the
reactor. When the in ﬂuent water was replaced, all the previously
treated water was removed and replaced with ready-made arti ﬁcial
wastewater.
2.3. Analytical methods
The eﬄuent and in ﬂuent of each reactor was stored in a 50 mL
sampling bottle after passing through a 0.45 μmﬁlter membrane. After
sampling, the samples was detected immediately or placed in a re-
frigerator at 4 °C for testing ( Wenjie et al., 2014 ). Partial nitri ﬁcation

2.6. DNA extraction and quantitative PCR

extracted DNA were determined via micro-ultraviolet spectro-
photometry (Q5000, Quawell, USA) ( Wang et al., 2019; Zhang et al.,

Quantitative PCR (qPCR) was performed using primer pairs cbbLR1-

3.1. Nitrogen removal performance
Fig. 2 shows the changes in nitrogen in the groups A –D. The in-
oculated sludge was obtained from the partial nitri ﬁcation sludge do-
mesticated and cultured in laboratory and had a NAR of 99.4%.
Therefore, each group of sludge had a good NAR. Fig. 2A shows the
nitrogen changes in groups A1, A2, A3, and A4 under di ﬀerent in ﬂuent
NH4+-N concentrations. With increased in ﬂuent NH 4+-N, the highest
NH4+-N conversion and NO 2–-N accumulation rates (57 and 95.65%,
respectively) occurred in A2. The e ﬄuent NH 4+-N, NO 2–-N, and NO 3–-
N concentrations were 0.86, 14.34, and was 0.65 mg/L, respectively.Increasing the NH
4+-N concentration of in ﬂuent may decrease the
partial nitri ﬁcation activity. The conversion rate of NH 4+-N in A1 was
higher than the accumulation rate of nitrous nitrogen, which may be
due to the low concentration of in ﬂuent NH 4+-N, the conversion of",ts/Carbon sequestration pathway of inorganic carbon in partial nitrification sludge.pdf,3
"higher than the accumulation rate of nitrous nitrogen, which may be
due to the low concentration of in ﬂuent NH 4+-N, the conversion of
some NH 4+-N into NO 2–-N, and the volatilization and escape of some
NH4+-N. The relatively high concentration of e ﬄuent NO 3–-N in A4
may be due to excessive aeration and dissolved oxygen. Therefore, the
highest nitrogen accumulation rate of partial nitri ﬁcation sludge was
95.65%, when the in ﬂuent concentration of NH 4+-N was 15 mg/L in
group A.
IC is a substrate for autotrophic bacteria and has an important im-
pact on their normal metabolism; it therefore also impacts AOB. Fig. 2Bshows the changes in nitrogen in B1 –B4 under di ﬀerent in ﬂuent IC
concentrations. In B1, the conversion rate of NH 4+-N was 69.57%, and
the eﬄuent NH 4+-N concentration was 4.65 mg/L. The low conversion
rate under this condition may be due to the low concentration of HCO3–
in the in ﬂuent. The conversion rates of NH 4+-N in B2, B3, and B4 were",ts/Carbon sequestration pathway of inorganic carbon in partial nitrification sludge.pdf,3
"rate under this condition may be due to the low concentration of HCO3–
in the in ﬂuent. The conversion rates of NH 4+-N in B2, B3, and B4 were
similar at 93.26, 93.25, and 93.12%, respectively. The NAR in B2 –B4
was 96.95, 96.60, and 96.69%, respectively. The NAR was therefore thelowest in B1, but the NO
3–-N concentration in B1 e ﬄuent was the
highest. Based on the NH 4+-N conversion rate, it is further speculated
that the low IC concentration in the in ﬂuent may be the result of the
inhibition of partial nitri ﬁcation. There was almost no change in the
NAR value of the B2-B4 group. Therefore, when the inﬂ uent IC con-
centration was 250 mg/L, su ﬃcient carbon source could be supplied for
the ammonia oxidizing bacteria to utilize itself, and the NAR is 96.95%.

relationship between IC in in ﬂuent water and average carbon seques-

inhibit the partial nitri ﬁcation. An increased IC concentration can im-

to increased release of CO 2into the system. When enough IC is added,

Table 2 shows the experimental results of the isotope experimental
group (IEG). The data were analyzed via the Student ttest. Compared
with the blank sample, the NH 4+-N conversion, NO 2–-N accumulation,
and average carbon sequestration rates of IEG were relatively stable,
and there were no signi ﬁcant di ﬀerences (p-value > 0.05). In terms of
isotope detection in sludge, there were no signi ﬁcant di ﬀerences be-
tween the carbon content of the blank sample and IEG (p-value >
0.05). However, the abundance of δ13C and13C% content (VPDB) were
signiﬁcantly lower than those of the blank sample (p-value < 0.01).
Furthermore, the isotope content in the sludge samples was greater inthe IEG after NaH
13CO3labeling than it was in the blank sample. The
standard deviation between parallel samples was small, indicating thatthe test results had good reproducibility. The results further showed

3.4. qPCR
The Calvin cycle is a major CO
2ﬁxation pathway in nearly all
ecosystems. Rubisco is regarded as a key functional enzyme in the
Calvin cycle and exists in multiple natural forms (such as forms I, II, III,
and IV) ( Hanson & Tabita, 2001 ). The cbbL gene is commonly used to
encode a large subunit of form I Rubisco ( Kusian & Bowien, 1997 ). In
this study, cbbLR1 was used as the marker gene of the red-type Rubisco
form I cbbL gene ( Selesi et al., 2005; Wahlund & Tabita, 1997 ). AOB
DNA was analyzed via qPCR to explore the carbon sequestration
pathway in partial nitri ﬁcation. DNA extraction and analyses were
carried out by thawing the stored sludge of every group at the end of
the experiment. The purity of the extracted DNA was good and met the
requirements of subsequent experiments. Therefore, qPCR was per-",ts/Carbon sequestration pathway of inorganic carbon in partial nitrification sludge.pdf,6

requirements of subsequent experiments. Therefore, qPCR was per-
formed on the samples.
Fig. 5 shows the average abundance of the cbbLR1 gene, and the
control group consisted of pre-treatment sludge samples. The copy
number of cbbLR1 before partial nitri ﬁcation sludge treatment was
7.50 × 108. The average number of gene copies a ﬀected by NH 4+-N,
IC, Ca2+and Mg2+, and microbial accelerant were 1.27 × 109,
1.07 × 109, 1.04 × 109, and 1.10 × 109, respectively. The number of
cbbLR1 gene copies increased after treatment, and increased most under
the inﬂuence of nitrogen. The variation range of the gene copy number
in partial nitri ﬁcation sludge under the in ﬂuence of NH 4+-N was larger
than that under the in ﬂuence of the other three substrates.

The correlations between cbbLR1 gene abundance in partial ni-
triﬁcation sludge under di ﬀerent conditions and in ﬂuent substrates
(nitrogen concentration, IC, Ca2+and Mg2+, and microbial accelerant)
are shown in Table 3. The response of cbbLR1 gene abundance to ni-
trogen was slightly greater than its response to the other three sub-
strates. Therefore, functional gene cbbLR1, which follows the Calvin
cycle carbon sequestration pathway, is likely present in the partial ni-triﬁcation sludge. The response of cbbLR1 gene abundance to nitrogen
in AOB was greater than that to IC, Ca
2+and Mg2+, and microbial
accelerant. There was a signi ﬁcant correlation between cbbLR1 and
NH4+-N concentration, IC concentration.

4. Conclusions
The following conclusions could be drawn from batch simulation
experiments of partial nitri ﬁcation reaction: carbon sequestration rate
of partial nitri ﬁcation was positively correlated with in ﬂuent NH 4+-N
and negatively correlated with IC. In wastewater containing IC, AOBcan immobilize IC into microorganisms through the cbbL gene in Calvin
cycle and become the carbon source needed for their growth. Finally,AOB released a small amount of CO
2into the air, so that partial ni-
triﬁcation doesn ’t need additional organic carbon source to provide theenergy for microorganism growth. CbbL gene was signi ﬁcantly corre-
lated with the changes of in ﬂuent NH 4+-N and IC.

水孔隙 (water-filled pore space ，WFPS)、土壤氧氣含量、土壤酸鹼值與溫度變化等

肥料種類和氮素量是影響氧化亞氮釋放量的重要因素。銨態氮的硝化過程
或肥料中是否有硝酸態氮及其含量是農田土壤氮素損失的前提；土壤無機氮量增加，氧化亞氮生成亦隨之增加。在適宜土壤條件下，施用無機氮肥、動物廄肥及生物性固氮等方式大量輸入氮源，均會導致土壤氧化亞氮釋放量大幅增加，所增之量因土壤條件和氮肥種類而異。以有機質肥料為作物生長的氮素來源，因同時提供了大量有效性碳源，將有利微生物增殖，進而促進土壤與堆肥中的有機氮礦化；又微生物增殖易產生微區域之氧氣消耗，而致厭氧產生脫氮作用，造成氧化亞氮釋放量較高。植物殘體回田措施亦會增加土壤氧化亞氮釋出，植物體的化學性質和掩埋量為影響因子，目前以植物體的氮含量、木質素和多酚可被用以預測氮礦化速率，繼而推估氧化亞氮生成量。
土壤在飽和水分處理下，氧化亞氮生成量一般大於浸水狀態和田間容水量。
當浸水時，土壤處於還原態，氧化亞氮主要來自脫氮作用，而當土壤在田間容水量時，通氣較佳，故氧化亞氮主要伴隨硝化作用生成。比較浸水狀態和和田間容水量之氧化亞氮發生，兩者並無固定趨勢，通常當充水孔隙高於 50%時，氧化亞
氮釋放量將增加。
農業產生氧化亞氮主要受到土壤中硝化作用及脫氮作用控制，土壤微生物活
性、硝化及脫氮速率都隨土壤溫度的升高而增加，溫度除影響產生氧化亞氮的過程外，亦影響調節土壤中氣體傳輸速率的物理化學參數，所以，溫度是影響氧化亞氮產生與釋出的一個重要因素。

 Phytolith occluded carbon (PhytOC) which is stable in 
 the soil environment is considered to be an important 
 fraction of soil organic carbon and substantially con 
 tributes to the terrestrial carbon sequestration for 
 long periods (millennia). Phytoliths are silica bodies 
 produced by plants as a result of biomineralization 
 process. During this process, occlusion of carbon also 
 takes place within the phytoliths. Some of the major 
 agricultural crops like barley, maize, rice, sorghum, 
 sugarcane and wheat are known to be prolific produc

"sugarcane and wheat are known to be prolific produc 
 ers of phytolith and PhytOC. In India, an estimate 
 indicates that these crops may annually contribute 
 about 87 million tonnes (mt) of PhytOC. Hence, a 
 great potential exists to enhance PhytOC accumula 
 tion in the soils of various agro-ecosystems. The rate 
 of phytolith production and the carbon occluded in 
 phytoliths vary among the plant community. In India, 
 an estimate indicates that these crops may annually 
 contribute about 87 mt of PhytOC and growing high 
 PhytOC-yielding cultivars of these crops may addi 
 tionally produce 1.05 mt of PhytOC. Therefore, selec 
 tion of high PhytOC-yielding cultivars over low 
 PhytOC-yielding cultivars for agricultural production 
 under different agro-ecosystems offers an opportunity 
 to enhance terrestrial carbon sequestration.

 Global warming and rapid increase in the concentration 
 of atmospheric C02 have contributed to an increased 
 awareness of carbon sequestration in the soil. Terrestrial 
 carbon sequestration is fundamental to the global carbon 
 cycle and is being utilized to counter increases in anthro 
 pogenic C02 emissions. So far several approaches are 
 being adopted to mitigate global C02 emissions and to 
 sequester carbon in the soil. However, these approaches 
 restore C in the soil only for a short span of time. Long

 land area available for woody plant production has be

 production. Therefore, a more recent approach to improve 
 phytolith occluded carbon (PhytOC) accumulation in 
 plants and soils was demonstrated to increase the world 
 carbon stocks of soils in various agro-ecosystems3-6.

 Phytoliths and their importance 
 Phytoliths (phyto means 'plant' and lithos means 'rocks' 
 in Greek), also referred to as 'plant opal' or 'plant stone', 
 are silica bodies produced by plants as a result of biomin 
 eralization. The soluble silica from the soil, particularly 
 in the form of monosilicic acid (Si(OH)4), is absorbed by 
 the roots and carried to different plant parts through the 
 vascular system. During the subsequent process, the silica 
 is deposited in the intra- and extracellular structures of

 the leaf, stem and root systems16. Cell wall, cell lumen 
 and intercellular spaces of the cortex are three sites where 
 silica is mainly deposited in the plant tissues17. The 
 amount of silica accumulated in the plant tissues ranges 
 from 0.1% to 10% of the dry weight18. The size of the 
 silica bodies that are deposited in the plant tissues mostly 
 ranges between 10 and 30 pm and is occasionally up to 
 200 pm (ref. 19). The cell-wall deposits of silica often 
 replicate the morphology of the living cells. During the 
 biomineralization process, occlusion of carbon takes 
 place within the phytoliths20. These PhytOC are most 
 likely the original cytoplasmic organic constituents7, 
 simple carbohydrates12 and cellulose21 depending upon

"processes has been well documented63-73. The rate of 
 phytolith accumulation in the soil is also affected by fac 
 tors other than plant species, including soil properties, 
 climate and geomorphology57. The quantity of phytoliths 
 in the soil varies from several orders of magnitude at the 
 regional scale57 depending upon the type of phytolith 
 containing above-ground biomass. For example, varia 
 tions in opal yield in plants ranged from 10 kg ha-1 yr~' in 
 conifer forest of arid New Mexico74 to 300 kg ha 1 yr-1 in 
 prairie grassland of temperate Oregon75. Although the 
 concentration of phytoliths in the soil generally consti 
 tutes up to 3% on a total soil basis57, some soil horizons,  particularly the upper layer (5-30 cm) of tropical podsols 
 of biogenic origin are almost completely composed of 
 siliceous phytoliths76.

 Estimated annual PhytOC accumulation rates (0.72

 reported to be similar3. In the case of temperate soils, the 
 average PhytOC accumulation rate was 15 g m 2 yr 1 (réf. 
 9). But in similar soils in Ohio, the average carbon con 
 tent of phytoliths was 2.40% and PhytOC accumulation 
 rate was 0.36 g C rrf2 yr 1 (ref. 9). PhytOC accumulation

 about 30% of total non-grain biomass produced from 
 these crops finally reaches the soil through residue incor 
 poration, wastes after feeding the animals, animal excreta, 
 farmyard manure in the form of compost and burnt ash.

 In India, the major cereal crops grown are rice, wheat, 
 maize and sorghum, and in many parts of the country 
 these crops are cultivated during two or three seasons in a 
 year. The area under cultivation of rice, wheat, maize, sor 
 ghum, sugarcane and barley in India is 44, 28, 8.4, 9.2, 
 4.2 and 0.8 m ha respectively81. Considering the reported

 of phytolith, total phytolith and PhytOC yields for these

 (Table 6). At the same time if we take maximum phyto

"vars with high PhytOC yielding cultivars, 1.05 mt of 
 additional PhytOC production can be enhanced annually. 
 Fate of PhytOC and its management in soil 
 PhytOC is a stable inert carbon fraction which remains in 
 the soil for a long period. But it is transported to different 
 places by wind, water, bioturbation and other mechanical 
 means. However, the biochemical change of this fraction, 
 particularly microbial oxidation, is very low or may not 
 even take place. There are evidences that have revealed 
 that PhytOC is not affected by forest fire, or biochemical  changes that occur in the intestine of mammals while it 
 passes through an animal's stomach during digestion. 
 There are many reports on the translocation of this carbon 
 fraction within the soil. Alexandre et al}2 reported trans 
 location to a depth of 2.2 m in a ferrallitic soil, with a 
 slight accumulation in an impermeable clay layer at 1.3

"location to a depth of 2.2 m in a ferrallitic soil, with a 
 slight accumulation in an impermeable clay layer at 1.3 
 1.4 m. Humphreys et al}3 attributed the distribution pat 
 tern in Podzol mainly to translocation with percolating 
 water. In contrast, Piperno43 pointed out that the magni 
 tude of transport is probably minimal because phytoliths 
 occur commonly only in the upper part of recent soils and 
 their concentration usually decreases in B horizons. The 
 main factor which is responsible for the translocation of 
 PhytOC is its size and shape. Larger sized fractions are

 the diameter of phytoliths ranges between 5 and 50 pm 
 (equal to the size of silt fractions in the soil). Although 
 silt particles are less mobile than clay particles, the

 Several soil processes and soil characteristics affect the 
 phytolith distribution in a soil profile other than direct 
 translocation mechanisms. These include the availability 
 of macropore channels, the intensity of phytolith aggrega 
 tion with clay particles, organic substances and oxides, 
 and phytolith dissolution. A potential key determinant of 
 phytolith transport is soil structure, in particular, conti 
 nuity of macropore channels85. Field experiment on phy

 downward translocation in a loamy sand (Cambisol) and 
 a silty loam (Luvisol) in southern Germany86. The mean 
 travel distance after one year was 3.99 ± 1.21 cm in the 
 Cambisol and 3.86 ± 0.56 cm in the Luvisol. About 50% 
 of the phytoliths were recovered below 5 cm depth in 
 both soils86. Transport in intact soil was significantly 
 faster than in packed sand, indicating a crucial role of 
 continuous macropores in transport efficiency. 
 It was estimated that conversion of cultivated agricul 
 tural land to either forest or grasslands contributes about 
 33.5 g C m~2 yr""1 (réf. 1) and switching from conventional 
 to no tillage practices resulted in additional carbon 
 sequestered by 50.7 g C m 2 yr_1 (ref. 87). Carbon seques

"changes in tillage practices can be further enhanced 
 through PhytOC accumulation in the soil by growing 
 high PhytOC-yielding cultivars. 
 Conclusions and future perspectives 
 To sum up, the opportunity exists to enhance both short 
 and long-term carbon sequestration by cultivation of high 
 PhytOC-yielding plant species of agricultural crops. The 
 carbon sequestration potential of sugarcane varieties 
 ranged lfom 0.12 to 0.661 e-C02 ha*1 yr*1. Therefore, pre 
 ference of high PhytOC-yielding variety over low 
 PhytOC-yielding variety results in a net increase of 
 0.54 t e-C02 ha*1 yr*1 of carbon securely sequestered in 
 phytoliths. Phytolith production may vary depending 
 upon the cultivars, which in turn depend on environ 
 mental and management conditions. All the phytolith 
 produced in plants may not reach the soil. There may be 
 several factors that control phytolith accretion in the soil.

"produced in plants may not reach the soil. There may be 
 several factors that control phytolith accretion in the soil. 
 They are crop factors like crop species and age, parts of 
 the plant it accumulated, phytolith content, size and shape 
 of the phytolith and amount of crop residue that reaches 
 the soil, and soil factors like structure, particularly 
 macropore channels, texture, clay content, soil water and 
 microbial communities and its activity in the soil. Hence, 
 PhytOC produced in the plants species under a specific 
 environmental and management situation and the amount 
 that reaches the soil should be quantified. The processes 
 and properties that affect the stability and the losses of 
 PhytOC from the soil need to be studied extensively. The 
 potential of PhytOC fraction for increasing soil carbon 
 sequestration in different crop production systems needs 
 to be re-examined.

"potential of PhytOC fraction for increasing soil carbon 
 sequestration in different crop production systems needs 
 to be re-examined. 
 In future, studies should be mainly focused on the 
 application of breeding and biotechnological tools for 
 identification of the trait that would result in identifica 
 tion of crop cultivars with much greater PhytOC yields. 
 Such a plant-breeding programme would provide growers 
 with even greater opportunities to securely bio-sequester 
 carbon in their crops than that exists at present. Enhanc 
 ing the potential of PhytOC production and accumulation  in crop species through external application of silica 
 needs to be explored.

"agricultural nitrogen fertilizer input, the effect of nitrogen on the sequestration of soil organic carbon
(SOC) is controversial. To facilitate a comprehensive understanding of this issue, the progress of
recent studies on the different SOC stabilization mechanisms is reviewed. Based on the differences
in the stability and fate mechanisms of particulate organic carbon (POC) and mineral-associated
organic carbon (MAOC), nitrogen input can increase POC input and inhibit microbial decomposition
of POC by increasing terrestrial biomass, changing the quality of litter and promoting the formation
of aggregates. N input reduces the chemical stability of MAOC by altering the chemical bonding of
mineral–organic complexes. This study has promising implications for understanding the effect of N

1. Introduction
Soil organic carbon (SOC) is a signiﬁcant indicator of soil fertility, and its sequestration
is a vital strategy to mitigate greenhouse gases. The soil carbon pool is the largest in
terrestrial ecosystems, accounting for 81.2% of the carbon in the ecosystem and containing
about 250 billion tons of soil organic carbon [ 1]. For the global soil carbon cycle, even a
minor disturbance will cause a great response to the climate [ 2]. In addition, organic carbon
also has a variety of functions. For example, chemically organic carbon is a store of soil
nutrients; physically, it improves soil aggregation and water-holding capacity (WHC), and
biologically it increases the energy supply of microorganisms [3].",ts/C and N.pdf,0
"nutrients; physically, it improves soil aggregation and water-holding capacity (WHC), and
biologically it increases the energy supply of microorganisms [3].
The ﬁxed potential of soil organic carbon is related to the quantity and quality of input
organic matter, soil microbial activity, and physical and chemical properties [ 4–6]. Soil
carbon and nitrogen are closely coupled, and nitrogen is involved in the biogeochemical
cycle of carbon as an energy supply element for microbial and plant growth [ 7]. Since the
1960s, nitrogen fertilizer use has increased dramatically [ 8]. Nitrogen input can gradually
affect soil organic carbon stocks by altering the importation of fresh particulate organic
carbon to the soil [ 9] and the output of microbially decomposed organic carbon [ 10].
Previous studies have reported that organic carbon sequestration under N addition may
change in three different directions of change: increasing, constant, and decreasing [ 11–13].",ts/C and N.pdf,0

high C/N [ 15]. The rate of SOM decomposition is positively related to soil nitrogen effec-
tiveness; therefore, increasing nitrogen effectiveness accelerates SOM decomposition and is
detrimental to SOC sequestration. However, nitrogen increases SOC input by promoting
plant growth and plant litter formation [ 16]. At the same time, nitrogen input also inhibits
the decomposition of SOC by reducing microbial activity and promoting the formation of
aggregates [ 17]. The main effect of inorganic nitrogen input on soil’s physical and chemical
properties is to cause soil acidiﬁcation. The conversion of ammonium nitrogen applied
to agricultural soils to nitrate nitrogen through nitriﬁcation, the uptake of ammonium
nitrogen by plants, and the loss of nitrogen by leaching all lead to soil acidiﬁcation [ 18,19],

Previous studies have suggested that a decrease in PH under N addition drives Al
toxicity [ 21], reducing fungal abundance [ 17,22] and inhibiting microbial catabolic activity.
Chang [ 23] et al. conducted a two-year ammonium nitrate application experiment on alpine
ecosystems. They found that MWD values of soil aggregates were signiﬁcantly higher,
MWD positively correlated with SOC content, and MWD negatively correlated with CO 2
release. Thus, increased nitrogen effectiveness can enhance soil organic carbon input and
slow down soil organic carbon decomposition, promoting soil SOC sequestration. Overall,
the effect of N input on soil organic carbon turnover is attributed to the interaction between
plants, soil physicochemical properties, and microorganisms.

"plants, soil physicochemical properties, and microorganisms.
Previous studies focused on microorganisms’ organic carbon cycle [ 23–25]. In compari-
son, there were few studies on the transformation and ﬁxation of organic carbon of different
components in soil under nitrogen input. The division of organic carbon into particulate
organic carbon (POC) and mineral-associated organic carbon (MAOC) is fundamental
to understanding organic carbon turnover processes. Numerous previous studies have
shown that the MAOC fraction, mainly derived from microbial residues [ 26,27], has a slow
turnover, is difﬁcult to decompose, requires large amounts of nitrogen for its formation,
and has a limited storage capacity. In contrast, the POC fraction, an essential precursor
to MAOC, is mainly derived from plant and animal residues and root secretions [ 28], is
susceptible to external disturbances, has poor stability and rapid turnover rates [ 29,30],",ts/C and N.pdf,1

carbon pools have different turnover rates and stability, there are also different conver-
sion directions and stabilization mechanisms for the effects of nitrogen addition (Table 1,
Figure 1 ). Nitrogen addition promotes aboveground biomass in nitrogen-limited terrestrial
ecosystems [ 31], but there is signiﬁcant uncertainty about belowground organic carbon
cycling and ﬁxation. Therefore, this paper reviews the research progress in recent years

2. Particulate Organic Carbon (POC)  
Particulate organic carbon (POC) is usually composed of undissolved or partially de-
composed animal, plant, and root residues [26]. It refers to the part of organic carbon com-
bined with soil sand, which has a fast turnover rate and is vulnerable to external interfer-
ence. It is a component and quantitat ive indicator of soil active organic matter [32]. The 
mineral ization of POC is mainly restricted by the chemical resistance of imported soil or-
ganic molecules and the physical protection of large aggregates.

root secretions and plant residues [33]. Global net primary production of vegetation (NPP) 
is limited by N, with NPP increasing by up to 30% under N deposition [34]. Although this 
implies a higher POC input, there are differences in the direction of SOC sequestration in 
soils. Previous studies have shown that the net rate of soil organic carbon fixation is pos-
itively correlated with root mass. Fornara et al.  [35] found that a potential mechanism for 
SOC accumulation in grassland soils is an N -induced increase in root mass through long -
term NH 4NO 3 addition experiments on grassland soils. However, Lajtha et al. [36] did not

bioavailable energy supply [37]. Soil acidification from excess N inputs can also lead to 
increased levels of toxic elements such as Al and Mn [38]. In acidic environments, heavy 
metal ions are more likely to bind to water in an ionic state. The more acidic the environ-
ment, th e higher the ionic solubility and the easier it is for plants to take up or migrate, 
leading to lower/net primary productivity and reduced POC input.

litter, where microorganisms are more likely to obtain high-quality inputs and improve
litter turnover, is not conducive to POC sequestration but can effectively form MAOM,
which is beneﬁcial to SOC accumulation in the long run [ 42–44]. In contrast, high C/N
recalcitrant litter resists microbial decomposition in the short term and contributes to the
accumulation of short-term carbon pool POC, but less of the initial material is converted to
microbial products that can be stably present. [ 45]. Nitrogen addition can also inﬂuence the
conversion of SOC in soils by altering plant community composition [ 35]. High N addition
drives the conversion of terrestrial vegetation from C4 to C3 plants, which have lower C/N
and higher root mass than C4 plants [ 46], contributing to a more efﬁcient transformation of

Soil aggregates are the basic structural unit of soil and the leading site of organic

located in aggregates [ 47]. The spatial segregation of microorganisms and organic carbon
generated during the formation of aggregates is the primary stabilization mechanism of soil
organic carbon [ 48]. Soil aggregates’ stability was signiﬁcantly and positively correlated
with SOC content [ 49], especially the POC fraction [ 50,51]. Chen et al. [ 52] found that POC

3. Mineral-Associated Organic Carbon (MAOC)
Mineral-associated organic carbon (MAOC) is the most stable and longest turnover
organic carbon. The sorption of organic matter by soil minerals prolongs the ecosystem’s
organic carbon cycle. It reduces its bioavailability [ 26,71]. Microbial growth rate and
microbial residues control the amount of newly formed MAOC, since microbial residues
are an essential source of MAOC formation [ 72,73]. Clay minerals and iron aluminum
oxide hydrate in soil minerals play a signiﬁcant role in organic carbon stabilization [ 74].
Ligand exchange adsorption of soil minerals on organic matter, multivalent cation bonding
bridges, complexation of free Ca2+, Al3+, and Fe3+and their mineral forms on organic
ligands, hydrogen bonding, condensation, and van der Waals forces are the main chemo-
protective mechanisms for MAOC persistence [ 75,76]. Thus, N addition may affect MAOC",ts/C and N.pdf,6
"ligands, hydrogen bonding, condensation, and van der Waals forces are the main chemo-

sequestration through two pathways. First, N addition alters microbial CUE and thus
microbial mass carbon by affecting the microbial activity and community structure; sec-
ond, soil acidiﬁcation due to N addition triggers changes in the chemical bonding of
mineral–organic complexes.
3.1. Microbial Carbon Utilization Efﬁciency
Microorganisms mediate the transfer from plant inputs to mineral-related organic
carbon pools and are the main drivers of the soil carbon cycle [ 77]. Microbially driven soil
C dynamics may be closely related to microbial catabolic and anabolic processes [ 78]. In the
process of decomposing organic matter, one part of organic matter is lost through respiration
and extracellular enzymes, and the other part is converted into microbial biomass carbon",ts/C and N.pdf,6
"process of decomposing organic matter, one part of organic matter is lost through respiration

the concept of a “soil microbial carbon pump,” a theoretical system that deﬁned for the
ﬁrst time the “entombing effect,” i.e., the long-term microbial assimilation process leads
to the continuous accumulation of iterations of microbial residues, which promotes the
formation of a series of organic substances including microbial residues. Microbial carbon
utilization efﬁciency (CUE) [ 80] is the efﬁciency of converting total organic carbon absorbed
by microorganisms into microbial biomass carbon. Under thermodynamic constraints, the
maximum theoretical value of CUE is 0.8 [ 81], which indicates that up to 80% of organic
carbon can be converted to MBC, and at least 20% of organic carbon is used to sustain",ts/C and N.pdf,6
"maximum theoretical value of CUE is 0.8 [ 81], which indicates that up to 80% of organic

microbial respiration and secretion of extracellular enzymes.
Nitrogen availability strongly inﬂuences microbial CUE because microorganisms
require energy to balance catabolic and anabolic reactions. N input drives changes in
microbial CUE by altering soil microbial activity and community structure, substrate
quality and bioavailability, and ecological stoichiometry [82,83].
3.1.1. Microbial Community Structure and Activities
Microbial community structure and activity are the strongest drivers of CUE because
different microbial communities metabolize organic carbon in different pathways [ 84].

"Fungi exhibit high CUE because they have a more comprehensive range of C/N variability
than bacteria and have a higher demand for C [ 77]. Hawkes et al. [ 85] concluded that the
dominance of fungi in soil implies higher carbon stocks.
Both increased nitrogen effectiveness and changes in soil pH under N addition can
induce a rapid shift in microbial communities [ 86,87], but the two are contradictory. Higher
nitrogen effectiveness drives a change in microbial community structure toward bacterial
dominance [ 22,88], which negatively affects CUE because bacteria have a higher demand for
soil nutrients than fungi [ 22]. Soil acidiﬁcation due to N addition drives a shift in microbial
community structure towards fungal dominance. Bacterial/fungal community structure

Nitrogen additions can also affect microbial activity by altering soil pH [ 88]. Soil acidiﬁ-
cation caused by excessive mineral N input forces microorganisms to allocate large amounts
of SOC for energy production [ 92], which inhibits microbial growth and reduces microbial
CUE. Organic N input alleviates soil acidiﬁcation and enhances microbial CUE [ 93]. First,

the increased C limitation during N enrichment. Soil acidiﬁcation due to N enrichment
signiﬁcantly increased the fungal: bacterial and MBC: MBN ratios [ 119], thus reducing the
C/N gap between microbial biomass and its resources. Furthermore, this gap decreased
linearly with decreasing soil pH, resulting in a shift from N limitation to C limitation.
Nitrogen-induced changes in biological C accessibility have an essential role in the growth
of microbial C metabolism. N addition decreases C availability by increasing the N content
in plant litter [ 120], decreasing C/N in the soil matrix, and reducing C availability. Second,

N and thus release less carbon to soil microbes [ 123]; third, soil acidiﬁcation caused by
N addition reduces plant productivity and root exudation, thus reducing effective soil
C [124]. Fourth, the mass of organic matter decreases under N addition, and condensation
reactions between mineral N and organic matter increase recalcitrant organic matter [ 125].
However, it has also been suggested that increased plant carbon input and reduced mineral
protection [ 126] under N addition can alleviate microbial C limitation by increasing soil C

3.1.3. Substrate Quality and Bioavailability
Microbial CUE may be inﬂuenced by the substrate quality and the metabolic pathways
used for substrate utilization, as microbial decomposition uses soil organic carbon and
plant residues to sustain its life activities [ 127,128]. Microbial decomposition of low-quality
substrates (e.g., lignin) requires more enzymatic processes [ 129], increasing microbial
extracellular enzyme secretion and respiratory metabolism and resulting in lower microbial
CUE. As Allison et al. [ 130] found, difﬁcult-to-use polymers such as lignin and cellulose
must depolymerize to be taken up by microbial cells, which means that microorganisms
reallocate more C elements from cell growth to extracellular enzyme secretion.

"N addition inhibits microbial CUE by reducing substrate quality in four main ways.
First, N addition usually promotes the production of recalcitrant substrates (e.g., lignin) of

degrading enzymes secreted by fungi [ 116,131], reducing substrate effectiveness, as lignin
can bind to or physically prevent access to other compounds (e.g., cellulose) in plant
tissues. Third, nitrogenous compounds may react chemically with phenolics to promote the
production of recalcitrant organic matter [ 132], and Gillespie et al. [ 133] found that NH 4+
forms anti-biodegradable complexes with lignin. Fourth, nitrogen-containing compounds
can also coagulate with carbohydrates, producing melanin [ 134]. Melanin is a highly

main factor affecting soil minerals’ surface charge and sorption sites is pH [ 17]. Nitrogen
addition can affect the persistent sequestration of MAOC by lowering the soil PH and
changing the mineral–organic complex interaction.

Fe-Al oxides have a variable charge, and clay minerals have a permanent negative
charge [ 137]. Kaiser et al. [ 138] found a positive correlation between soil organic carbon con-

acidic conditions [ 137]. They can promote the chemical bonding of mineral–organic com-
plexes through several effects: ﬁrst, Fe-Al oxides and their hydrates immobilize negatively
charged organic matter in soils through positive and negative charge adsorption [ 139];
second, Fe-Al oxides and their hydrates act as a bond bridge for clay mineral–organic
matter binding to form a clay mineral–Fe-Al oxides–organic matter tri-complex [ 57]; third,
the positively charged Fe-Al oxides also neutralize the negative charge on the surface of
clay minerals and promote the adsorption of organic matter [ 140]. Therefore, the decrease
in pH caused by nitrogen addition can promote organic carbon adsorption by soil minerals.
However, oxalic acid in root secretions under N addition increases microbial access to
MAOC by releasing organic compounds from protective association with minerals [ 126].",ts/C and N.pdf,10
"However, oxalic acid in root secretions under N addition increases microbial access to
MAOC by releasing organic compounds from protective association with minerals [ 126].
Furthermore, most of the H+also reacts with soil clay minerals, releasing aluminum from
the soil aluminosilicate mineral structure and producing exchangeable Al3+, leading to a
decrease in soil buffering capacity [ 141], which is detrimental to the long-term ﬁxation of
soil organic carbon.
3.2.2. Bond Bridge
MAOC content depends on the balance between the adsorption and desorption of
charged compounds. Bond bridges formed by Ca2+and Mg2+are the primary stabilization
mechanism of organic carbon bound to minerals in neutral and alkaline soils [ 142]. H+
competes for adsorption sites with exchangeable salt-based cations such as Na+, K+, Ca2+,
and Mg2+during soil acidiﬁcation [ 20], leading to extensive leaching of salt-based ions,
which affects the metal bond bridges of mineral–organic complexes and reduces the chemi-",ts/C and N.pdf,10
"and Mg2+during soil acidiﬁcation [ 20], leading to extensive leaching of salt-based ions,
which affects the metal bond bridges of mineral–organic complexes and reduces the chemi-
cal stability of organic matter. Ye et al. [ 17] found that the Fe-bound organic carbon content
increased and the total mineral–organic bound carbon content decreased with decreasing
pH in alkaline soils. They suggest that acidiﬁcation partially shifts the mineral-organic
complexes from calcium ion bond bridges to iron ion bond bridges.
Microorganisms generally have the ability to superoxide (O2−). Long-term use of organic
nitrogen fertilizer significantly increased soil bacterial diversity, generated easily mobile Fe
oxides [ 143,144], stimulated Fenton/Fenton-like reactions catalyzed by Fe minerals in the
soil, and promoted the formation of hydroxyl radicals (HO ·) (Equations (4) and (5) ) [145].

rhizal fungi, and among fertilizer types, methods of measurement, biomes, and leadinvestigators. Relationships between degree of response and study length, fertilizationrates, total amounts of nutrients applied, and numbers of replicates were also tested.•Across studies, mycorrhizal abundance decreased 15% under N fertilization and
32% under P fertilization. Elevated CO

 elicited a 47% increase. Nitrogen effects
varied signiﬁcantly among studies, and P effects varied signiﬁcantly among leadinvestigators. Most other factors did not affect mycorrhizal responses.•These results support the plant investment hypothesis, and suggest that global

Introduction 
Since nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and carbon (C) are each
required by mycorrhizal fungi, the availability of each nutrient
could control mycorrhizal abundance.

"could control mycorrhizal abundance. Plants provide C bytransferring carbohydrates via roots; soils supply N and P .One of the more widely tested hypotheses within the ﬁeld of
mycorrhizal ecology is that plants should invest more C inmycorrhizal fungi where N or P are limiting to plant growth,since mycorrhizal fungi contribute to nutrient uptake byplants (Mosse & Phillips, 1971). Conversely, if N or Pavailability rises, a decline in mycorrhizal abundance isexpected as plants allocate carbohydrates elsewhere andmycorrhizal fungi become C-limited (Read, 1991). Analternate possibility is that mycorrhizal fungi are directlylimited by soil nutrient availability and should proliferatefollowing additions of N or P (T reseder & Allen, 2002). Thesemechanisms apply to both arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) and
ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi.

Controls over mycorrhizal dynamics by C, N, and P are

2002), while fertilization with N and P (as land is convertedto agriculture) and anthropogenic N deposition enhance soilfertility (Vitousek, 1994). Humans may be altering global andregional distributions of this ecologically and economically
important microbial group.
To what extent do large-scale ﬁeld experiments support the
hypothesis that mycorrhizal fungi will increase under elevatedCO

mycorrhizal abundance, including natural climatic variability,
intact soil fauna and microbial communities, and establishedsoil structure. As such, results from ﬁeld experiments areparticularly useful in predicting mycorrhizal feedbacks in eco-systems under global change. Previous reviews have reportedhigh variation among studies in AM colonization of rootsunder elevated CO 
2 
 (Staddon & Fitter, 1998) and in external
hyphal lengths of AM and ECM fungi under N enrichment(T reseder & Allen, 2000), so that delineations of generalresponses are difﬁcult. Meta-analysis provides a quantitative,
statistical means of integrating independent results, and ofidentifying aspects of experimental design that might contri-bute to variation among studies (Gurevitch

Meta-analyses were performed on data

 availability, in comparison
with an unmanipulated control. Short-term or smaller-
scale studies were not included, because it is possible that
mycorrhizal fungi could temporarily proliferate to exploitsmall ‘hot spots’ of nutrients (Jackson  
et al 
., 1990; Hagerberg 
et al 
., 2003). If so, short-term responses would not necessarily
reﬂect long-term effects. In CO 
2 
 experiments, this study
included free-air CO 
2 
 enrichment (FACE), open-top
chamber, and closed-chamber designs if they were establishedon pre-existing soil. Planted vegetation was accepted in thecase of agricultural systems only, because my objective was toinclude studies that represented natural systems as closely aspossible in order to best approximate widespread effects ofglobal change. In addition, I limited my data collection toresults in which means, standard deviations, and replicate",ts/New Phytologist - 2004 - Treseder - A meta‐analysis of mycorrhizal responses to nitrogen  phosphorus  and atmospheric.pdf,1

between pre-existing levels of soil N or P and mycorrhizalbiomass were not considered.
Because one assumption of meta-analysis is that studies are
independent from one another (Gurevitch & Hedges, 1999),I used only one set of data from a given system. For instance,mycorrhizal abundance was often measured several timeswithin a given study. In these cases, I restricted my analyses to",ts/New Phytologist - 2004 - Treseder - A meta‐analysis of mycorrhizal responses to nitrogen  phosphorus  and atmospheric.pdf,1
"the latest sampling date, since global change is often long-term. (Mycorrhizal responses did not vary signiﬁcantly withstudy length in the ensuing meta-analyses.) If more than onepublication presented results from the same ﬁeld plots, I reliedupon data from the most recent paper. In addition, severalstudies applied nutrients at a range of levels; in these cases,I only included data associated with the highest applicationrates. Conversely, if a particular publication reported resultsfrom more than one study system that could reasonably beconsidered independent (e.g. different geographical location,fertilizer type, ecosystem, or dominant vegetation), each sys-tem was designated as a different study. Effects of N, P , andCO

 were examined in individual meta-analyses in order to
avoid redundancy of control groups within studies that simul-taneously tested more than one effect (Gurevitch & Hedges,1993).

When morethan one index of mycorrhizal abundance was reported withina given study, percentage colonization data were selectedin order to facilitate comparisons with other studies thatmeasured colonization only.

Results
Nitrogen fertilization
Across studies, N fertilization reduced mycorrhizal abundance
by an average of 15% (Fig. 1), but with signiﬁcant variationamong studies (QT = 100, d.f. = 30; P < 0.00001). Moreover,
a meta-analysis restricted to percentage colonization dataindicated a smaller, but still signiﬁcant, decrease of 5.8%(Table 2), again with signiﬁcant heterogeneity among studies(Q
T = 84.8, d.f. = 26, P < 0.00001). Aspects of experimental
design inﬂuenced how mycorrhizal fungi responded to N. Inparticular, declines in mycorrhizal abundance were slightly
more pronounced under higher rates of N application ( R =

−4 * [rate] + 0.905, P = 0.020), although two studies
with application rates of 1000 kg N ha−1 h−1 (Hutchinson
et al., 1998) had large leverage. When these two studies
were omitted, no signiﬁcant effects of application rate were
apparent. Replicate number was weakly negatively relatedto R ( R = −0.0372 * [replicate number] + 0.964, P = 0.007),
potentially because studies with more replicate plots also hadhigher rates of N additions (Table 1). Neither the totalamount of nitrogen added nor the duration of fertilizationwas a signiﬁcant factor. Likewise, we found no signiﬁcanteffects of mycorrhizal type, fertilization type, measurementindex, biome, or lead investigator (Table 2).
Phosphorus fertilization
Mycorrhizal fungi declined moderately under P fertilization,",ts/New Phytologist - 2004 - Treseder - A meta‐analysis of mycorrhizal responses to nitrogen  phosphorus  and atmospheric.pdf,4
"Phosphorus fertilization
Mycorrhizal fungi declined moderately under P fertilization,
with an average reduction of 32% (Fig. 1). Moreover, variationamong studies was nonsigniﬁcant (Q
T = 22.5, d.f. = 19, P =
0.259), indicating consistency among systems in mycorrhizalresponses to P . Response ratios did not differ between AM and
ECM fungi, among type of fertilizer applied, among biomes,among measurement types, or as a function of fertilizationrate, fertilization duration, total amount of P added, orreplicate number. However, R varied signiﬁcantly among lead
investigators (Table 2). When analysis was restricted to studiesthat reported percentage colonization, P effects were stillsigniﬁcant (Table 2).

However, responses to N were less consistent than were
responses to P and elevated CO2, given the heterogeneity in
N effects among studies. Replicate numbers within N studiesinﬂuenced response ratios, but not substantially. What othercharacteristics of the studies might be responsible for theremaining variation in N effects? It is possible that mycorrhizal

"fungi may not be as effective in facilitating plant uptake ofinorganic N compared with inorganic P (Mosse & Phillips,1971; Smith & Read, 1997). In particular, nitrate is more
mobile in the soil than is phosphate, so diffusion or mass ﬂowmay supply N at adequate rates in nitrate-rich systems. Underthese circumstances, plant investment in mycorrhizal fungimay be minimal even in control plots. Alternately, mycorrhizalgrowth may be N-limited in some ecosystems (T reseder &Allen, 2002) so that N fertilization increases mycorrhizalabundance.

N deposition effects on mycorrhizal biomass for any givenecosystem is relatively low. The smaller conﬁdence intervalsfor N effects vs P or CO

A more diversesampling of nutrient effects within tropical forests, deserts,boreal forests, and woodlands/shrublands would improve thepossibility of establishing general patterns among and withinbiomes.

the others, since this parameter is a function of standing rootlength as well as mycorrhizal biomass (Allen, 2001). Coloni-zation levels can be interpreted as an assessment of relativeallocation toward mycorrhizal fungi by plants. For this reason,additional meta-analyses were conducted on % colonizationdata only. Effects of N, P , and CO
2 remained signiﬁcant – but
smaller – despite the reduction in sample size. Standing stocksof ﬁne roots tend to increase under elevated CO

variable (Ostertag, 2001), so it is difﬁcult to relate % colon-
ization to mycorrhizal biomass in fertilization studies withoutspeciﬁc data from each study. Even though percentage colon-ization tended to be associated with smaller response ratios,there was no evidence for signiﬁcant differences among typesof measurements used.
In summary, mycorrhizal abundance generally increases
under elevated CO
2 and declines in response to N and P
fertilization across studies. Plants may adjust allocation of Cto mycorrhizal fungi according to the degree to which plantgrowth is N or P limited, as hypothesized (Mosse & Phillips,1971; Read, 1991). Direct limitation of mycorrhizal fungiby soil nutrients appears to be at most a secondary control,evident in a subset of studies.
